A longer version for the curious
================================

<br>
Too many interests and not enough time to indulge in all of
them is my daily struggle. I love learning and applying that
knowledge to solving problems. I'm humble and satisfied with
life, but also very disciplined and proactive. I come from
Zagreb (Croatia) and ZÃ¼rich (Switzerland) is my current home.

Professionally
--------------

I started working as a back-end developer during my computer
science studies. Over time, I drifted towards front-end and
really liked it. Design is closely related to front-end, so I
dabbled in design more and more because of my earlier love for
drawing and psychology.

I've worked mostly in smaller companies on projects for
international clients and markets. I even started a small
studio with a couple of good friends at one point; we had a
great time for a couple of years and tasted the hard life of
running a business.

I'm currently working as an interaction designer at Google and
YouTube. Web and mobile are where I fight for a better use of
technology and a great user experience.

Privately
---------

I like to read and spend time with friends and family when I'm
not working. I love to exercise and to be outdoors. Over the
course of my life I've tried a lot of physical activities,
sometimes suspecting that I might be "an exercise addict".

If you like to get updates on design, technology and lifelong
learning, you should follow me on
