A longer version for the curious
================================

I'm a young guy from Croatia who has too many interests and
not enough time to indulge in all of them. I love learning and
applying that knowledge to problem solving. I'm humble and
satisfied with life, but also very disciplined and proactive.

The "wizard engineer" is a term I coined because I find both
words describe me in a specific way.

WIZARD
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_(fantasy)">
    A person who uses or practices magic that derives from
    supernatural or occult sources. His powers arise from
    **his study**, rather than having his magical abilities
    occur entirely spontaneously.
</blockquote>
Many things I do may seem like magic to a lot of people, but
there's nothing magical about it - just a lot of hard work.

ENGINEER
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer">
    A professional concerned with applying scientific
    knowledge to develop solutions for technical problems.
</blockquote>
I'm a science fan. I like to apply psychology to interface
design as well as computer science to building software.

Professionally
--------------

I'm currently an interaction designer and a front-end
developer in [Five Minutes][1]. Web and Mobile is where I
fight for better use of technology and great user experiences.

I also co-founded a small web and mobile service company
[Tardigrada][2] a few years ago. It's a bit quieter now, but
still alive.

While acquiring my computer science degree, what now seems a
long time ago, I started working as a back-end developer.
After some time I gravitated towards front-end and really
liked it. Design is very close to front-end so I managed to
mix my love for drawing and psychology with user interface
design. Having worked on a lot of projects, I had to think
about product development and user experience, and that puts
me where I am today.

Privately
---------

The line between private and professional life is pretty
blurred for me because I really love what I do. That's why my
private time is also filled with technology and design.

On those occasions when I manage to separate myself from the
screen I usually hang out with friends and family. I love
exercising and being outdoors. Over the course of my life I've
tried different ball and racquet sports, swimming, weight
training, running, cycling, ice and roller skating, hiking,
orienteering, spelunking (caving), dancing, archery, white
water rafting and parachuting. And I'm always eager to try
something new.

If you managed to get to here, I congratulate you :)
