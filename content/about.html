A longer version for the curious
================================

<br>
Too many interests and not enough time to indulge in all of
them is my daily struggle. I love learning and applying that
knowledge to solving problems. I'm humble and satisfied with
life, but also very disciplined and proactive. I come from
Zagreb, Croatia and ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland is my current home.

Professionally
--------------

I started working as a back-end developer while acquiring my
computer science degree, what now seems a long time ago. I
gravitated towards front-end after some time and really liked
it. Design is closely integrated with front-end so I managed
to mix my love for drawing and psychology with user interface
design.

I had worked mostly in smaller companies on projects for
international clients or markets. I even started my own studio
at one point with a couple of good friends; we had a great
time for a few years and tasted a hard life of running a
business.

I'm currently an interaction designer in Google and YouTube.
Web and mobile is where I fight for a better use of technology
and a great user experience.

Privately
---------

I like to read and spend time with friends and family when I'm
not working. I love to exercise and to be outdoors. Over the
course of my life I've tried a lot of physical activities,
sometimes suspecting that I might be "an exercise addict".

learning, you should follow me on
