A longer version for the curious
================================

<br>
Too many interests and not enough time to indulge in all of
them is my daily struggle. I love learning and applying that
knowledge to problem solving. I'm humble and satisfied with
life, but also very disciplined and proactive. I come from
Zagreb, Croatia and ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland is my current home.

Professionally
--------------
While acquiring my computer science degree, what now seems a
long time ago, I started working as a back-end developer.
After some time I gravitated towards front-end and really
liked it. Design is very close to front-end so I managed to
mix my love for drawing and psychology with user interface
design. Having worked on a lot of projects, I had to think
about product development and user experience, and that puts
me where I am today.

I had mostly worked in smaller companies on projects for
international clients or markets. I even started my own studio
with a few good friends; we had a great time for a few years
and tasted the hard life of entrepreneurship.

I'm currently an interaction designer in Google. Web and
mobile is where I fight for better use of technology and great
user experiences.

Privately
---------
On those occasions when I manage to separate myself from the
screen I usually hang out with friends and family. I love
exercising and being outdoors. Over the course of my life I've
tried different ball and racquet sports, swimming, weight
training, running, cycling, ice and roller skating, hiking,
orienteering, spelunking (caving), dancing, archery, white
water rafting, diving and parachuting. And I'm always eager
to try something new.

learning, you should follow me on
