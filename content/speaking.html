<p class="post-meta">Conference, 2014-02-15, Zagreb, Croatia</p>

<h2>Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing</h2>
<p class="post-meta">University, 2013-12-18, Zagreb, Croatia</p>

Title: The basics of design and user interfaces

Introducing basic design principles to computer science
students in a guest lecture as a part of "Java in business
environments" curriculum. After the lecture we continued with
a sketching workshop where students presented interfaces of
their projects and we tried to find problems and possible
solutions to them. _(Repeated the same talk from last year,

<h2>Webtanken</h2>
<p class="post-meta">Conference, 2013-11-28, Kristiansand, Norway</p>

Title: Mobile Commerce&mdash;Technical Overview

Smartphones became essential part of our lives even though
they went mainstream only a few years ago. The consequence is
that we're still learning how people use mobile technology and
especially how they approach mobile shopping. There are many
different technologies to build your m-commerce solution upon,
each with specific pros and cons. In this talk I presented
what technology to choose in a particular situation and how
each solution empowers customers and improves online store
business. 

<h2>Advanced Technology Day 9</h2>

<h2>Windays 13</h2>
<p class="post-meta">Conference, 2013-04-24, Umag, Croatia</p>

Title: Building Modern Software:  User Experience and Design

Do you remember the days when all that was needed was to be
first or have the most features? They are over. Users have
become much smarter and more demanding. The only way to be
successful is to think of design being as important as
engineering. This talk described how designer and developer
roles intertwine from the beginning and how they should have
user's goals in mind during the whole project.

The other half is client and team communication. This talk
revolved around visual communication tools like sketches,
wireframes and clickable prototypes, all with the goal of
having shared understanding of the project.

<p class="post-meta">Meetup, 2012-03-22, Zagreb, Croatia</p>

<p class="post-meta">Meetup, 2011-10-25, Zagreb, Croatia</p>

Title: Static website generators

Static websites are back. They're fast, secure and simple, and
if you need dynamic parts, most of it can be done through
JavaScript. They are not cure for everything, but have their
specific uses. There are many tools&mdash;static website
generators&mdash;that can help you with building and managing
one.
