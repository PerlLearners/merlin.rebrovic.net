There is a lot of history in this simple photo.

A [traffic light man][1] is a remnant of East Germany--West
had a generic one--and is now a symbol and a popular souvenir
in Berlin.

In the background is [Detlev-Rohwedder-Haus][2]. The building
was constructed in 1936 and is a prime example of Nazi
architecture. It housed Luftwaffe until the end of World War 2.

When Berlin was finally overrun by Allies, Soviets
occupied the building because the city was in ruins. Trying
to dismantle Nazi government from a Nazi building is a one of
life's nasty ironies.

Today this building houses probably the most feared
institution of all--Ministry of Finance. Yes, Germans pay
taxes here.

To take this specific photo, I had to stand where the [Berlin
Wall][3] once was. It stood there for almost three decades,
completely defining modern history of Berlin and leaving a
permanent mark on generations of its inhabitants. And probably
on the rest of Germany too.
