A couple of people asked me about aliases from my Git
workshop, so here are those we used. Just put them in your
<code>.gitconfig</code> and feel free to modify them for your
own workflow.

    [alias]
        co = checkout
        br = branch
        ci = commit
        st = status
        d = diff
        l = log --graph --oneline --decorate

The last alias can be improved with a timestamp and an author
in the same line, but you have to use custom formating:
<code>l = log --graph --pretty=format:\"%C(yellow)%h%Cred%d%Creset %s
%Cblue(%ar) %Cgreen%an\"</code>

There are also some [Git tips and tricks][1] I shared late last year.
