{% mark excerpt %}
I am always asking people and scouring the Internet for good
book recommendations. Even though I exchange tips in person, I
rarely broadcast what is worthy of your time. Time to change
that.

The year 2015 was not as good as some others with regards to
drowning in good reads, but there were some golden nuggets I
would like to share.

Man's search for meaning
------------------------

Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl lost his family and survived Nazi
imprisonment. His experience and those of others who came to
him for treatment after the war led him to coin a theory
stating that our primary drive in life is the pursuit of what
we find meaningful. We often can't avoid suffering, but we can
decide how to cope with it. In the end, our mindset is more
important than our environment.

I used some of the quotes from the book in my post about
[humor and meaningfulness]([[ blog/humor-and-meaningfulness.html ]]).


Work rules!
-----------

Laszlo Bock was leading Google's People Ops for a decade
during company's rapid growth. In his book he openly shares
successful techniques for hiring, motivating, and compensating
people, but also talks about lessons learned from failed
experiments. If you're managing a team or running a company,
this is a book for you.

Customs of the World
--------------------

This is a course by The Great Courses, but I consumed it as an
audiobook. Aside from being an interesting history lesson, the
course compares major cultures of the world against ten
dimensions: individualists versus collectivist, direct versus
indirect, punctuality versus relationships, and so on. I
currently work in a highly diverse environment, and the book
helped me understand why people from different cultures behave
in their ways and how to adapt to different communication
styles.

It's Complicated: the Social Lives of Networked Teens
-----------------------------------------------------

A Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Danah Boyd writes
about young people's use of social media. She explores what
networks they use, how it affects their lives, and debunks
myths about teens being careless oversharers and social media
addicts.

Astronaut's guide to life on Earth
----------------------------------

The final two books are unique because they explore peculiar
jobs. The first one is a memoir of the astronaut Colonel Chris
Hadfield. He explains his long journey from a young age to
working inside the International Space Station. Aside from
telling humorous and inspiring stories, he also tries to teach
us a valuable life lesson: prepare for the worst and think
through potential failures because this is the only way to
stay calm under immense stress.

Junkyard Planet
---------------

A vast majority of people don't think about where all things
they throw away end up. But it has to go somewhere, and for an
industry mostly hidden from our view, it is a gold mine. Adam
Minter lead us through the US and Chinese recycling operations
which often are, although better than mining, not as "green"
as we think they are. This book is an eyeopener.
