    I left Croatia and soon found that Alan Ford comic is not
    as widespread as I initially believed. I also learned that
    cultural references are hard to explain to others.

_Alan Ford_ is a comic series started at the end of 1960s.
Alan is a member of a small group of mostly clumsy and lazy
secret agents operating from a flower shop in New York. Their
actions are filled with satire and black humor often pointing
to issues in Western society.

This introduction would be redundant if you're from a former
Yugoslavia country. Just saying _Alan Ford_ would be enough
to set a stage for either a discussion or a joke. And this is
where I stumbled.

The comic was extremely popular in Croatia for decades. My and
my parents' generation read it. Even if someone didn't, they
probably knew it existed and some main characters. It's a
common reference both in everyday speech and in media. It's so
pervasive that I took it for granted. And I mean, why wouldn't
I? I was still a kid, all grown-ups knew about it and the
story unfolded in the US. In that pre-Internet time this meant
it was as known as Star Wars. [What a mistaka to maka.][1]

My narrow-minded perspective got obliterated [when I left
Croatia][2]. Frequent references during conversations to
either _Alan Ford_ characters or situations were all met with
blank stares. I attributed the first couple of misses to
chance, but afterwards I started to worry. Even when I tried
to explain, they didn't get it because the required context is
huge. Maybe it wasn't them, maybe it was me? 

A quick search provided all the answers I needed, but didn't
really want to hear. The comic was only popular in
Italy--where it originated--and former Yugoslavia. There were
attempts to expand to other countries, but they all failed.

That got me thinking on how many seemingly unrelated things
are subtle ingredients of a popular culture. One thing by
itself may not be noticeable, but a lot of them added together
represent a big chunk of common knowledge and context which
everyone can reference. It becomes a part of country's
culture. When you go away, it's almost impossible to take it
with you. It's also hard to learn intricacies of other
countries and cultures; not because someone wants to hide them
from you, but because they are often not aware of them
themselves.

Using _Alan Ford_ in everyday speech was living in a bubble.
But it was a fun bubble and I miss it.

Translation for non-Croatian speakers:  

Parrot: _"Why are you so angry? You can buy a hundred cameras
with the amount she gave you."_  
Old man: _"It's a matter of principle. It's not fair to steal
something and then have it stolen from you."_
