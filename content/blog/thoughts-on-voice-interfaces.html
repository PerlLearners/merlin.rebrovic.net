Talking to inanimate objects usually meant people need
professional help. Sometimes we say nasty things to a leaking
washing machine or a TV showing a football match, but we never
talk to a fridge or a hairdryer. Things are slowly changing
with phones and computers, but we're still using it to talk to
other people, not devices. What happens when there isn't a
person on the other side? And why aren't we doing it more?

## Slow adoption

Despite speech recognition being available in consumer
electronics for a long time, it hasn't been used much in
everyday situations. I think there are a couple of reasons:

1. Technology wasn't good enough  
   I don't remember one piece of everyday technology that was
   doing it right. For example, I was trying it out on Windows
   Mobile a while back. There were pre-set voice commands, but
   they were very limited and if my pronunciation wasn't
   perfect or if I said a non-English name, I hit a wall. To
   be fair, it's a very tough problem to solve on a computer
   even if humans understand each other without problems. But
   we're seeing some good progress recently. Ubiquity of
   Internet access on many devices and powerful software
   running in the cloud really makes a difference in the last
   year or two.   

2. Foreign languages  
   If people don't speak English or some other major language,
   they are out of luck. Support for non-dominant languages is
   still not very functional.

3. Social norms  
   Many notes, commands and searches are awkward when said out
   loud in public transit or while waiting in a queue, even if
   they could be perfectly normal in proper context. And there
   are some places, like classrooms, where talking is frowned
   upon.

4. "Isn't that from a sci-fi movie?"  
   Believe it or not, there are people who don't know speech
   recognition is functional and available on their
   smartphones today. It hasn't been until only recently and
   nobody told them something changed. If people don't know
   something is possible, they won't try it.

## Potential

I think there are many areas where voice will be the optimal
input method and that will push adoption and quality.

1. Young generations  
   Kids start to talk before they can write so this could be
   their second way of interacting with technology after
   touch. "Play cartoons with cute bears" is something a four
   year old can say, but not write. They will carry those
   interactions into their adult age and they won't feel so
   awkward.

2. Speed  
   Unless a person is typing all day for a living, speech is a
   faster input method than a keyboard. When we get to
   negligible number of speech recognition errors, it could
   replace a lot of typing. Just think of transcribing
   interviews, meeting notes, medical examinations or chatting
   in real time with someone who has to receive text. Benefits
   like that will shift a lot of usage to voice.

3. Accessibility  
   It will be a game-changer for visually impaired people or
   those with physical disabilities (eg. tremors or
   repetitive stress injuries). There are many others who will
   find it useful, of course.

4. Context  
   Driving, playing games and cooking are some activities
   where hands are busy and voice is free to ask and command.

## A perfect example

I received a new version of my health insurance contract last
week. It was a couple of pages in German and I could get the
gist, but there were a lot of unknown words; they tend to be
important in contracts, especially in fine print. I opened
Google Translate app and selected voice input. Every time I
stumbled upon an unknown word, I would say it in German and
get the English word spoken back. It was so fast I was able to
read the whole document in a matter of minutes and it was
almost like having a native speaker by my side.

Who knows where it will take us in a couple of years, but I'm
sure it will be interesting.
