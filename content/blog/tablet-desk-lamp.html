The hotel room I'm currently staying in has terrible lighting;
it's almost impossible to read from paper. The work desk at
the corner is even darker. To draw on it would be impossible,
so I devised a little improvised desk lamp.

"A tablet as a desk lamp.") }}

The app I'm using on my Nexus 10 is [Galaxy Nexus
Flashlight][1]. It's really simple and elegant, but the
selling point for me was that it can be used with the
screen turned off. Try it out, it's nice.
