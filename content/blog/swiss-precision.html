Swiss precision is world famous, but sometimes it works
against you. A new car and an unknown road can easily get you
distracted, making you speed a bit as a consequence.

Cameras and radars are always watching, so they caught me in
the exact situation. I was driving 57 km/h in a 50 km/h area.
They had deducted 3 km/h as a safety margin and then mailed me
a ticket for 4 km/h I was over the limit.

There are almost no reckless drivers in Switzerland and now
you know why.
