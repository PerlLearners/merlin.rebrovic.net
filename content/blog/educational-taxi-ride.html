Shortly after initial pleasantries, a taxi driver says he's a
food blogger--starting his second blog--and would like to give
us some recommendations. He says "Get your iPhone out so you
can take notes". I respond "I use Android" after which a
couple funny comments get exchanged between us. He already
knows I work for Google and he asks do I need a ride to any
specific office; he knows them all by heart.

The ride is coming to an end with many good restaurant tips.
We stop in front of the hotel although he still doesn't
understand why I didn't use Airbnb for accommodation. "You
know they're a San Francisco company, right?" Using Square to
process my credit card reminds him when he dropped Jack Dorsey
off at the airport. He checks if I know that Jack is also
Twitter's co-founder.

It's like I attended "Digital Tech Contemporary History 101".
