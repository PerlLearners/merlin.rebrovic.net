A lot has happened in 2016. Many people would say it was the
worst year ever. It wasn't, but it had its challenges: from
wars and occupations, migrant crises, unexpected political
outcomes, to many artists leaving us forever. Even so, there
was one event that made this year one of the happiest for me.

Fatherhood
----------

I have become a dad in February. The tiny, fragile baby turned
out to be the biggest change in my life because, for the first
time, I was truly responsible for someone else. When I was
alone, or later with my wife, the decisions I made no effect
on others, or the affected people had a say in it. Now it was
more complex: a life would flourish or stumble depending on my
actions.

In spite of the huge life change, the (not so) surprising
realization was that I remained ... well, I. The new situation
provided another lens through which I could observe the world
in a different way, but my interests and needs stayed the
same. My free time, however, got decimated. I named the
resulting tug of war between the time I want to spend with my
son and the time I need for myself ["brutal prioritization"][1].

I also started to experience parental worry. For three decades
I couldn't understand why my mom asked me about food, health,
and being safe all the time. It all sounded like nagging. Now,
of course, I worry about my son too: did he eat, will he get
hurt, is he happy? The worry is constant and relentless. I try
to accept it as something that parents do.

Learning together
-----------------

You know how everyone says it's easy to learn when you're a
baby? I'm not so sure. They are clumsy as an intoxicated
panda, they can't talk, read, or write, and they shit their
pants every few hours. However, in spite of all the obstacles,
they still learn at a frightening pace. Every couple of weeks
there is something new they can do. And why? If babies are not
sleeping, they are learning. Every waking hour they try and
fail, try and fail, try and fail until they succeed. Then they
try something new and start the cycle again. They can be in
the room full of strangers, and they are not ashamed when they
don't succeed at first; nothing stops them from trying again.
Imagine how quickly you would learn if you would practice a
skill 10-12 hours a day and not be afraid of being judged. And
you have two things going for you: you can surf the Internet,
and you can use the toilet.

Fascination with mundane reminded me to put things into
perspective. Watching my son's pure joy while eating an orange
or seeing a ball fly through the air for the first time made
me realize that grown-ups often overlook simpler experiences
and try to find fulfillment in "something else." Spending time
with babies gives you a second chance to experience the world
for the first time.

Social media
------------

2016 was the year I started to question the benefits of social
media in my life. On a couple of occasions, I had to
disconnect for weeks at a time for personal or business
reasons. This is what happened:

* I didn't miss browsing the feed.
* I got more time out of the day.
* The world didn't collapse, and I got all important news
  through other channels (like talking in-person with people).
* Nobody, and I mean nobody, asked me why I wasn't sharing or
  commenting.

I wrote a post ["Your own media company"][2] in May with some
of the questions I was trying to answer at the time. A couple
of people responded and explained their perspective. In the
months following the post, I read a couple of books that
touched upon the subject and also attended a lecture from a
psychiatrist. Long story short, feeding the social media beast
can ruin our self-image, relationships, and make us
procrastinate.

The social media tools are not intended to harm us; we have
built them with the best of intentions. However, we are not
able to use them properly. The instant gratification they
provide overwhelm our brains. Think of alcohol--in small
amounts it makes a dinner meal enjoyable, but take too much
for too long, and it ruins everything. The free and unlimited
access (our smartphones) to social media is like a vibrating
self-replenishing flask of alcohol in your pocket--it is
dangerous and too hard to ignore.

I won't quit social media for now, but I'll keep it under
strict control.

Writing
-------

I'm running this personal blog for four years now. I wondered
many times what do I want to do with it. I don't get a lot of
traffic, but I also don't sell anything or don't need to build
an audience.

I noticed that writing helps me think. I write my messy
thoughts down and come back regularly to improve them.
Sometimes I can do that in a week. Sometimes I need to talk to
other people or read books to form my thoughts, and that can
take time. Drafts often stay drafts for months. Sometimes I
never publish finished pieces. However, the process of slow
reflection that happens while I write is why I keep coming
back to it.

I disabled website analytics in March as [an experiment][3]
because I didn't want website visits to serve as an external
validation (a form of "like"). From then on, I enjoyed writing
even more and never enabled the analytics back. [I write for
myself][4].

What's next
-----------

I see a lot of diapers in my future. Hopefully a lot of
laughter and enjoyable moments, too.

I have also been exploring new areas for professional growth
and new ways of learning. But that's a topic for another post.
Have a great 2017.
