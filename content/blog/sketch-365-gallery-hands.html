Hands are wonderful things. Together with our brains they have
enabled us to rise from cavemen to spacemen. Due to their
flexibility and shape, they're also very hard to draw. That's
why I dedicated a whole month in
[Sketch 365]([[/blog/sketch-365.html]]) to drawing hands. It
started as simple lines, measureas and blocks all the way to
... well, take a look.
