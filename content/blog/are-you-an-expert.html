A few days ago I watched a documentary named "Jiro Dreams of
Sushi". Jiro is regarded as the best sushi master in the
world, winning numerous awards around the world. One of them
is Michelin's 3 stars for his nine seat restaurant. Yes, nine.

He is 85 and works with sushi for more than 70 years. He likes
routine, constant improvement and dislikes holidays because
it's the only time he isn't working.

One thing that caught my attention is how self-critical he is.
He pushes himself very hard his whole life always trying to
learn more and improve his skill. When asked about this, he
says he still has so much to learn.

I hold similar views as Jiro. That's why I'm always fascinated
by people who call themselves experts, especially after being
in a field for a year or two, or even only a few months. What
are they experts of? To master any skill, you need many years
of learning and hard work. Reading a book or watching a few
online lectures is a good start, but only that.

So, work hard and be humble. Take Jiro's advice: "Love what
you do and immerse yourself completely".
