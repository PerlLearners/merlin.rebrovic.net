    A comic Sebastian drew after our conversation about the
    future of user-interfaces.

Sebastian Frederick MÃ¼ller and I had a chat about technology
recently, mostly about future user interfaces. When we
discussed a brain-computer interface, a specific scenario came
to his mind which he recorded in a comic. You can check the
comic on [190 Pages website][1] or on [Tumblr][2].
