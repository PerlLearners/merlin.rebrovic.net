The planned layover in Frankfurt is one and a half hour.
That's really comfortable. But when my plane is late 35
minutes on arrival, the shuttle bus gets stuck 10 minutes in
traffic and I get dumped on a wrong terminal, some very
worrying thoughts go through my head while I'm running around.
The new shuttle bus is quickly dispatched getting me closer to
my destination.

But then, one hundred Chinese are waiting in front of me for
passport control. It's the Great Wall of China! Luckily, I
kindly ask them if I can get to the front of the line because
my flight is due in 10 minutes and they say "yes". I bow and
run through.

As an aside, before that I asked a big white German guy
working there if he could help me. He asked me if I had an EU
passport. I said "no". He shrugged his shoulders and told me
to stand in line. It seems that by not being an EU citizen I'm
worth as much as a baggage trolley.

A bit more running, a security check and I'm the last one
going through the gate. The guy at the counter told me he was
just closing it. That was close.

Two hours later I'm trying to find a free seat at the packed
Copenhagen airport waiting for my next flight. I spot one, sit
down and close my eyes. I'm trying to relax from the whole
mess and think who should I thank for getting on time. I open
my eyes and see this ...

If that's not the sign from the heavens, I don't know what is
:)

P.S. The big display in the back of the store was playing the
"Angels in Bloom" fashion show. And you know what? The Angels
walking down the line is very relaxing.
