    A Princeton professor shared his CV of Failures in an
    attempt to provide some perspective into the ratio of
    successes and failures in someone's life.

Reading through other people's achievements makes it too easy
to fall into despair and self-doubt. Our own failures seem
numerous and successes not as significant. That's why a
Princeton professor shared his [CV of Failures (PDF)][1] with
this intro:

<blockquote>
Most of what I try fails, but these failures are often
invisible, while the successes are visible. I have noticed
that this sometimes gives others the impression that most
things work out for me. As a result, they are more likely to
attribute their own failures to themselves, rather than the
fact that the world is stochastic, applications are
crapshoots, and selection committees and referees have bad
days. This CV of Failures is an attempt to balance the record
and provide some perspective.
