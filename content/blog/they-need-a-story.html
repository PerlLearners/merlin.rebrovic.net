In [The Undoing Project][1], Michael Lewis explores life and
work of psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Their
scientific contributions to understanding the human mind and
its biases have transformed our world and earned a Nobel
prize.

As Daniel and Amos had started to uncover fallibility of human
decision making, they tried an approach called decision
analysis. As an experiment, instead of giving a report to
Israeli army in a form of an essay that could be
misinterpreted depending on how it was written, they would
write down possible outcomes and a percentage number next to
each outcome. That number was the best estimate of the odds.
