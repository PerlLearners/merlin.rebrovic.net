_"Love what you do."_ It's not a new thought; I've been
thinking about it for quite some time and even surfaced it in
a [post about lifelong learning][2] almost two years ago.
Nevertheless, it's not something I see very often. _"Doing
what you love"_ sounds more poetic and is regularly portrayed
as one of the biggest life goals you can achieve. And I agree
with a part of it--if you can choose, choose what you love
over other things.

But there are a few caveats with blindly pursuing that poetic
vision. Life usually won't provide perfect situations, but
compromises of good and bad things alike. There are a lot of
boring, repetitive or simply not "cool" tasks that have to be
done for something to be successful. For every line of code in
a new trendy language or for any mobile screen perfectly
designed for the newest platform update, there are docs to be
written, bugs triaged and fixed, field and user research
conducted, customers called, meetings conducted. And they
often take majority of our time.

Realizing that they are a necessary and very important part of
our work is just the first step. You also have to stop
dividing work between "love" and "hate" buckets because it
creates tension and internal struggle every day for not
working on _"what you love"_ all the time.

Instead, try to embrace all aspects of your current job and do
it the best you can. Fall in love with it, not because it's a
good mantra, but because it'll make your work outstanding.
