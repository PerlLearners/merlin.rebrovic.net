_"Love what you do."_ It's not a new thought. I've been
thinking about it for quite some time and even surfaced it in
a [post about lifelong learning][2] almost two years ago.
Nevertheless, it's not something I see often. "Doing what you
love" sounds more poetic and is regularly portrayed as one of
the biggest life goals you can achieve. And I agree with a
part of it--if you can choose, choose what you love over other
things.

However, there are a few caveats with blindly pursuing that
poetic vision. Life usually won't provide perfect situations.
Instead, life will serve a combination of good and bad things
alike. There are a lot of boring and repetitive tasks that
have to be done for something to be successful. For every line
of code in a new trendy language or any mobile screen
perfectly designed for the newest platform update, there are
docs to be written, bugs triaged and fixed, field and user
research conducted, and customers called. And they often take
the majority of your time.

Realizing that tedious tasks are a necessary and critical part
of your work is just the first step. You also have to stop
dividing work between "love" and "hate" buckets because it
creates tension and internal struggle every day for not
working on _"what you love"_ all the time.

Instead, try to embrace all aspects of your current job and do
it the best you can. Fall in love with it, not because it's a
good mantra, but because it'll make your work outstanding.
