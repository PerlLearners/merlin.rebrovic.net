San Francisco was much colder and less hospitable than I
expected. Maybe the stories about California's easy going
attitude and sunny weather skewed my perception beyond
reality.

Later I found a quote describing my sentiments perfectly:

> The coldest winter I ever saw was the summer I spent in San
> Francisco.
