I'm reading through ["The War of Art"][1] by Steven
Pressfield and have found a passage I believe many designers
will identify with.

<blockquote>
<p>Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an
indicator of aspiration. It reflects love, love of something
we dream of doing, and desire, desire to do it. If you find
yourself asking yourself (and your friends), "Am I really a
writer? Am I really an artist?" chances are you are.</p>

<p>The counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The
real one is scared to death.</p>
</blockquote>
