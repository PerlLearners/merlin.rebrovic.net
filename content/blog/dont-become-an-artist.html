    A quote from an interview with Erik Spiekermann about
    learning the concepts of technology. This is essential for
    every designer, otherwise there is no communication.

Yesterday I read [an interview with Erik Spiekermann][1], one
of modern design legends. One thing resonated with me. 

<blockquote cite="http://pi.co/erik-spiekermann/">
<p>Learn as much about our culture as you possibly can, by
reading, by traveling, by involving yourself in things that go
on. But don’t become an artist. Don’t think, “I’ll do it
intuitively.” You have to learn if not to code at least to
appreciate code, to understand code. Because code is what nuts
and bolts were a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>If you don’t know anything about mechanics, you can’t
survive in this world. If you don’t know anything about how a
computer works or code works, as a communicator, which is what
a designer is — the interface between machines and man, that’s
what we are. We are the interface, we interpret what the
machine says into visible language. If you don’t understand
how the machine works, you’re going to be laughed out of the
room by the engineering guys, because you can’t communicate
with them.</p>
</blockquote>

Maybe I'm biased because my background is computer science,
but I'm discounting that because Erik and I have very
different starting points (graphic design for him, programming
for me) and are two generations apart, and still came to the
same conclusion.

As designers, we don't have to build cars with our own hands
or use machine learning algorithms, but we need to know
concepts and how they work. If we don't know the vocabulary,
how will we communicate?
