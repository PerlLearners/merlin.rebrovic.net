March 12 was a very sad day. [Sir Terry][1] finally met one of
his Discworld characters, the one from the [artwork][2].

I was speechless. I read almost all his books in the last 15
years and I'm a big fan. I tried to write something when I
heard the news, but nothing came out. One [reddit user][3]
accurately described how I felt:

<blockquote>
I don’t feel I have the right to mourn.. that by rights should
be his family’s but I can't help but shed tears for the man
who wrote a universe for me to grow up in and kindly
companions to keep a growing boy company. Even now I dive into
his books and it’s like meeting old friends. Thank you sir for
giving us that. Your loss is felt far and wide.
</blockquote>

A few days ago I stumbled upon an interesting way to
commemorate Terry. It's a nerdy, non-obvious and technical,
but I find it very fitting. It's called [GNU Terry
Pratchett][4] and its mission is:

<blockquote>
Keeping the legacy of Sir Terry Pratchett alive forever.<br>
For as long as his name is still passed along the Clacks,<br>
Death can't have him.
</blockquote>

Clacks are like a telegraph nodes in Discworld, and they would
be servers in our world. The proposed solution is injecting a
custom HTTP header with Terry's name into every response from
a server. If you check under the hood of this website with
some developer tools, you will see this:

    Response Headers
      X-Clacks-Overhead: GNU Terry Pratchett

If you didn't read his books and this doesn't make any sense,
don't worry, it's meant to be obscure and for fans only.
Everyone interested in more context should read a longer
excerpt from Terry's book available on [reddit][5].
