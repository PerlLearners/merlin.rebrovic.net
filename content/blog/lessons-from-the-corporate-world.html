    Things I've noticed that are more prominent in a big
    company than in a small company.

"You need to have an opinion."

It wasn't the thing I wanted to hear, but there it was. My
experienced colleague was explaining the subtleties of working
in a big company and this came up as something you need to do
if you have or want a leadership position. The thinking goes
that the more "up" you go, people will look up to you and ask,
"what to do", "what do you think about this move", or "how
will this affect us". You can always say "I don't know" or
just stay silent in a crowded meeting where other people will
jump in. However, if you want to be seen as a leader, you have
to have an informed opinion. People don't follow individuals
who don't communicate where they're heading.

Even though the tip is short and non-ambiguous, it got me
thinking about other things in big companies that are
different from small companies. The more I've thought about
it, the more I've realized the things are not really that much
different, it's just that they don't come to prominence in a
small company. If you're working in a 20-person shop, everyone
knows everyone else, there is usually one boss (the founder),
and it's not as complicated as in a 20,000-person corporation.
However, the tips are relevant in both cases, so I decided to
write down lessons learned coming from a world where 100
people is a lot to a world where 50,000 people is not the
biggest player around.
