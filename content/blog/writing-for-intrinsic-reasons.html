From Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's book _Flow_:

> Not so long ago, it was acceptable to be an amateur poet or
> essayist. Nowadays if one does not make some money (however
> pitifully little) out of writing, it's considered to be a
> waste of time. It is taken as downright shameful for a man
> past twenty to indulge in versification unless he receives a
> check to show for it. And unless one has great talent it is
> indeed useless to write hoping to achieve great profit or
> fame. But it is never a waste to write for intrinsic
> reasons. First of all, writing gives the mind a disciplined
> means of expression. It allows one to record events and
> experiences so that they can be easily recalled, and relived
> in the future. It is a way to analyze and understand
> experiences, a self-communication that brings order to them.
