Kurt Vonnegut on how to write with style when English is not
your first language:

> All these varieties of speech are beautiful, just as the
> varieties of butterflies are beautiful. No matter what your
> first language, you should treasure it all your life. If it
> happens to not be standard English, and if it shows itself
> when your write standard English, the result is usually
> delightful, like a very pretty girl with one eye that is green
> and one that is blue.
> 
> -- originaly printed in Palm Sunday in 1999
