"It's beautiful" escaped my mouth when Ran, the last
Kurosawa's epic movie released in 1985, ended. Other than
that, I was speechless.

_Beautiful_ is not a word I usually use for movies. It's either
_entertaining_, _thought provoking_, _inspiring_, or _meh_.
I'm a fan of Kurosawa's movies, but somehow didn't watch Ran
until now. The imagery and powerful shots took me by surprise,
but reading about it on [Wikipedia][1] afterwards, it
shouldn't have. Kurosawa was a perfectionist and a visionary.

<blockquote>
He wrote the script shortly after filming Dersu Uzala in 1975,
and then "let it sleep" for seven years. During this time, he
painted storyboards of every shot in the film.

<blockquote>
Hidetora's third castle, which was burned to the ground, was
actually a real building which Kurosawa built on the slopes of
Mount Fuji. No miniatures were used for that segment, and
Tatsuya Nakadai had to do the scene where Hidetora flees the
castle in one take.

<blockquote>
The 1,400 uniforms and suits of armor used for the extras were
designed by costume designer Emi Wada and Kurosawa, and were
handmade by master tailors over more than two years. The film
also used 200 horses.

<blockquote>
He was fired from the 20th Century Fox epic “Tora! Tora!
Tora!” over what he described as creative differences, but
others said was a perfectionism that bordered on insanity.

If you want something done right, you have to put an insane
amount of work into it. Ran confirmed the maxim once again.
