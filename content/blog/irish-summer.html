My third visit to Dublin was also windy and rainy; no
surprises there even in late July. I remarked on the weather
to my taxi driver and he said:

<blockquote>
<p>Do you know when Noah had to build an ark because God
ordered him to do so? After Noah boarded the ark with his
family and all animals, it rained for forty days and forty
nights.</p>

<p>Best summer we ever had.</p>
</blockquote>
