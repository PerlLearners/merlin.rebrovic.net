"By doing it yourself in the first place." The answer is
deceivingly simple, but it works. People love consistency and
actions that match words. In those situations they feel safe,
can develop rapport and trust, which is usually followed by
accepting ideas and habits over longer period of time.

Human communication had begun long before spoken or written
word came into existence. That means we had to master reading
body language to be able to convey and receive a lot of
information. Even after we got hold of the full communication
repertoire, the body language is still dominant channel which
we use to get around 70-80% of information when communicating.

When spoken words and body signals are out of sync, our brains
fire a lot of warnings, even if we're not consciously aware of
it. This usually results in distrust, doubt and similar
negative emotions. If it happens regularly, we'll mark the
offenders as not likeable or with a hidden agenda, and we'll
usually try to distance ourselves from them.

Body language is short term and immediate, but the same
principles apply for a wide range of complex human behaviour,
habits and patterns.

## It starts when we're born

Most of the things we learn come from observation and mimicry.
Our parents serve as the first role models and our peers take
over later in school. As the time passes, more factual things
are learned orally or by reading, but the majority of things
that affect our behaviour are still learned by observing.

The interesting part is that nothing changes when we grow up.
By that time we have more experience and can catch more subtle
signals, which means other people's actions only affect us more.

## A scientific theory

There is a relatively new theory of _mirror neurons_ that
could explain why learning by observation happens. An
[interesting talk on TED][TED] by V. Ramachandran, one of the
researchers in the field, explains a theory in eight minutes.
A [Wikipedia article][w] on the topics says:

> A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an animal
> acts and when the animal observes the same action performed
> by another. Thus, the neuron "mirrors" the behaviour of the
> other, as though the observer were itself acting. ...
> Researchers argue that mirror neurons may be important for
> understanding the actions of other people, and for learning
> new skills by imitation.

So if you're watching a person performing an action, it's
almost like you're doing it yourself.

## Make the most of it

Science will eventually show us _why_ this phenomena happens,
but the fact that it's happening since time immemorial is
undisputed. There are a few ways you can use it to benefit
yourself or others.

If you want to start a positive change in yourself, surround
yourself with people who exhibit such behaviour. It's sometimes
hard to find motivation and energy to follow through hard
decisions and to make it a habit, but if people around you are
doing it every day, your chances are much, much higher. The
common saying that a person is mostly influenced by the five
closest people is true.

To influence someone else you have to be a part of the closest
circle of peers or a perceived authority.

**Peers**. One example is getting an addition to your
development team. What you and your teammates would like is
that this new person adopts team's best practices in coding
standards. One effective way is to talk to your team
beforehand and ask them to be really careful and aware of the
things they do because the new teammate will look at their
work and try to, with some instruction and mentoring, copy the
existing workflow. The first time someone makes a shortcut or
a sloppy piece of work in code, documentation or commit
messages during the "learning" phase, your credibility is
greatly undermined. What you have just demonstrated is that
it's sometimes OK to deliver suboptimal work due to time
constraints or negligence, even if it backfires in the long
run. That's probably not what you intended, but the message is
transferred nevertheless. I mentioned at the start of this
article that people love consistency and it's extremely
important in cases like this.

**Authority**. Teachers, bosses, religious leaders, experts in
a domain have a certain authority and if you're one of them,
it's much easier to start a positive change. You don't need a
circle of people (although it's much easier and effective that
way) and you can influence a lot of people at the same time.
The downside is that all eyes are pointing to you and watching
all the time. Consciously or not, every step is analyzed and
dissected. Many people in that position make a mistake of
thinking that _only what they say_ counts and that couldn't be
farther from the truth. Watchers are connecting every word you
say with your actions, and if they misalign, trust evaporates
like a dew in a dessert.

A teacher who scolds children for being late on class but
regularly fails to make it on time on the first morning class
is not a great role model. If they ask the teacher why there
are double standards and the only answer is "because I'm a
teacher", guess who won't be invited to a reunion or mentioned
as a childhood inspiration.

A manager who preaches open and healthy communication, but
often withholds information, talks about people behind their
backs and never in their face or criticizes them publicly will
find no one supporting his initiatives or even worse, find his
subordinates mirroring his behaviour and driving the company
culture to the ground.

If you're an owner of a small business hit by a bad cash flow
period and need to make some cuts, the best way would be to
openly communicate the problem to your employees. After the
measures have been set and put into motion, be very conscious
of your actions. Do you need a new computer you're using for
email and documents only or maybe one of your designers can
make a better use for it? Switch to a smaller car, take the
biggest pay cut and avoid expensive business dinners. When
people see you live by your words every day, they will soon
follow. Some of them will willingly leave a course to save
money, others will try harder to get a discount from a
supplier. Not getting a bonus will hurt less if you give up
yours. With a clear goal and people supporting you, it's very
likely you'll soon recover.

## Conclusion

People are very complex beings. Starting a change in others is
not a trivial thing. A person needs to be motivated to do it,
but that can be often accomplished with open communication and
a clear goal. The second ingredient is what this article is
all about - serving as a role model. That's the harder part.
"1% inspiration and 99% perspiration" comes immediately to
mind.

Before you start telling others what to do, look at yourself
first. If you're keen on inspiring your friends, cultivating a
company culture or building rapport, always lead with an
example. And do it consistently.

Stating that you only need to do
something and people will start to mimic you without a doubt
is naive; there are a lot of other factors involved.
Sometimes intimidation, blackmail or other manipulative
techniques work faster, but they are not ethical, work only
for a very short period of time and do not inspire long term
change.

With all that being said, serving as an example may not be
enough in all situations, but is absolutely mandatory to give
the change a chance. So if you're keen on inspiring your
friends, cultivating a company culture or building rapport,
always lead with an example. And do it consistently.


It's wasted words when parents who smoke three packs of
cigarettes a day say to children that it's bad for their
health or when obese friends sit in a fast food restaurant and
talk about diets and losing weight. A child will generally
ignore the words and do whatever other people around him are
doing.

Your peer that promotes a healthy
lifestyle and lives by it every day is considered honorable
and tenacious. On the other hand, if your manager insists on
you being on time for every meeting, but comes late, she will
not earn your respect.
