Steve Hilton, a former director of strategy for ex-Prime
Minister David Cameron, is a guest in one [Freakonomics podcast
episode][1]. At one point, he talks about his "transformational
experience" after learning about design thinking.

The situation is slow to improve in politics, but it's finally
moving in the right direction. [Government Digital
Services][2] in the UK started in 2010. They [focused on the
user][3] and completely changed the way digital services are
developed in governments. Their design process matches that of
the industry, and they open-sourced their content and code on
[GitHub][4]. The US recently followed the same example by
starting [USGS][5].

Let's wait and see. Or if your country is supportive, get
involved and help now. The sooner the services improve, the
better it will be for everyone.
