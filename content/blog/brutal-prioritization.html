The amount of time a person has in a day is finite. Although
such an obvious statement is seldom worth repeating, it became
my daily reminder since my son's birth a couple of months ago. 

I've lived through time-constrained situations before, but
they were never so clear-cut as the current one. For example,
if I had 20 things I wanted to do in a month--like exercising,
reading, going out, or watching movies--and enough time to do
only half of them, I was still able to do a lot. That created
an impression that I was on top of things. I could shuffle
various activities around and always remove one to make more
time for another. I embraced the flexibility and in turn
sacrificed some focus.

It's different now. Let's say I still have 20 things I would
like to do plus one extra--family. I dedicate most of my time
to my son and my wife because it's the most enjoyable and the
most significant activity, but that leaves me with only two
other free slots to fill in. And here lies the problem: If I
try to go through all the things I would like to do by
constantly changing them in the time I have left, it is going
to be neither productive nor fun.

I tried to cheat recently, and I squeezed in one more activity
pretending I have three slots. "I'll manage somehow," I said
to myself. Guess who didn't write for a month. The "finite
time" maxim proved right again.

The time constraint made me think deeply about my priorities,
and I realized I was conducting a brutal prioritization
process. Is this something I love and can't leave on the side?
If I skip it, will my family be worse off? If the answer is
"no", it won't happen. There were many noes, much more than I
would have preferred.

At the same time, the prioritization distilled what is truly
important to me. Even though I have less free time now, I am
more focused on activities that improve my life and happiness.
