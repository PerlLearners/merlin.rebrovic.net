UX Passion did a very good job of editing my talk on World
Information Architecture Day in February this year. They also
added some valuable insights on top of the talk [in their blog
post][post], so I encourage you to take a look if you're
interested in mobile navigation and information architecture.

You can read about [Redesigning Skype for Android chat][skype]
on this website; it is one of the examples I used in the talk.
