{% mark excerpt %}
Some time ago I read [Simple and Usable](http://www.simpleandusable.com)
book. It's very short, but to the point. This weekend I
stumbled upon the notes I had made so I decided to share them
with everyone.

## About people

* People love simple, dependable, adaptable products.
* Increasing complexity is unsustainable.
* Get out of your office; the best place to watch users is in
  their natural environment.
* Three types of users: experts, willing adopters,
  mainstreamers. Ignore experts, design for the mainstream.
* Mainstreamers want: getting the job done, ease of control
  (as opposed to the precision of control), reliable results,
  no fear of breaking something, good match, examples and
  stories.
* Emotional needs are important.
* Simplicity is about control.
* Focus on the main action and describe it as the user sees it
  (user stories).

There are four strategies for simplifying:

## Remove

* "Kill lame features. Broken gets fixed, but shoddy lasts
  forever." ~ Jack Moffett
* Remove words, simplify sentences.
* Lessen (information) load, isolate from distractions, remove
  sources of errors; every error breaks the concentration and
  makes the experience feel more complex.

## Organize

* Clear boundaries between groups.
* Grids.
* Size and location.
* Layers.
* Color coding.

## Hide

* Infrequent but necessary.
* Progressive disclosure: show simple, and complex if
  requested.
* NYT online edition shows a question mark icon when you
  select a word with a dictionary reference. Hide something
  completely, and reveal only when needed.
* Locus of attention - the area of the screen that the user is
  concentrated on.

## Displace

* Mobile vs desktop, user vs computer
* Conservation of complexity: sometimes the complexity cannot
  be reduced, only moved to another place.

If you like these notes, read the book, it's worth it.
