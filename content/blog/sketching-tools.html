Sketching is one of the disciplines where it's really easy to
start, especially because tools are widely available and
affordable.

## Technical pen

A technical pen leaves an even and full line even when varying
pressures or angles. It's excellent for technical drawings, but
it's also very good for getting rid of beginner's issues,
mostly the lack of determination. I've read somewhere that
it's good to start sketching with this pen because there is no
fumbling around with different strokes, pressures or anything;
you just have to sketch quickly and boldly. Rapid movements
and determination give a sketch crispiness and dynamics.

## Pencil

An old graphite pencil is still one of my favorites. You can
sketch thin or thick, light or strong, draw rough surfaces or
smudge them to get fine shadows and gradients. I feel a pencil
covers the widest range of techniques of all listed here.

Colored pencils can give you a more cheerful look and stronger
colors. Even if you use a very soft graphite pencil (like 5B),
a dedicated black pencil will be significantly darker. White
pencils are not for modern works of art (white on white), but
for sketching details and highlights on a dark background.

## Ballpoint pen

A ballpoint pen is a mix between a technical pen and a
graphite pencil. It uses ink, but the line thickness varies
with pressure.

## Marker

"A set of markers") }}

Markers complement technical pens very well because they
provide surface coloring, highlights and shadows. Technical
pens will not bleed like ballpoint pens when a marker is
applied over them.

There are different types of markers and literally hundreds of
colors available. A good way to start is to buy a black one
and a few light gray markers with broad tips for initial
outlines and shadows. You can add two or three colored ones
to the mix if you need some elements to stand out.

## Paper

I mostly use simple and thin printer paper. I tried others,
some were bleed proof and thicker, but if you are just
practicing and are planning to use hundreds of papers
throughout the year, the most cost effective way is to keep it
simple. If you use a lot of ink or markers, just stack two or
three papers together.

## Rulers and guides

Don't be afraid to use them. I though they were
a form of cheating at first, but after I had seen some very good
sketching artists use it, my concerns were dismissed. If you
need to draw a really straight line - use a helper. But don't
overdo it because then it's not sketching anymore, it's
technical drawing.
