    Technological progress is so fast that hardware and
    software ends up in a museum after only two decades.

_"They are showing me important history, something that
happened before I was born and significantly influenced my
life."_ This is what's going through my mind as I watch two
well-dressed gentlemen operate an old IBM punch-card computer.
Theyâ€™re so proud, and they should be, because they've fixed
those machines after being stored for decades, left to perish.
Now, the gentlemen are reliving their mid-twenties and it
feels full of energy.

They are fascinating, as is the whole exhibition in the
[Computer History Museum][1] in Mountain View, California. I
visited it last fall and wandered what it would be like to
have lived during those historic moments. To be in those
gentlemen's shoes and to show a part of history to younger
generations.

I didn't have to wait for too long. The other day, Fine
Brothers released a new reaction video: _Teens react to
Windows 95._ [Windows 95][2] is an operating system that
defined my exposure to technology in my teen years and where I
started to get into 2D and 3D computer graphics. It also
connected me to the Internet for the first time. That's why
it's interesting to see reactions from people who weren't yet
born during that time--the same reaction those gentlemen got
from me. Everyone in front of the camera is 19 years or
younger; Windows 95 is 21 years old. I highly recommend
watching the video.

Btw, did you know you can try [Windows 95 in a browser][3]?
