The [second WebCamp][wc2013] conference was held yesterday.
The [first one was][wc2012] a blast, but this one was even
better. I was lucky to attend a number of conferences,
domestic and international, big and small, one day and
multi-day events. There were some really good ones, but not
one comes close to WebCamp when ranked on friendliness. I'm
completely aware I'm biased, but when you see 600 friends and
familiar faces in one place, sometimes after a full year, it's
impossible to beat that special feeling.

I believe that atmosphere is a reflection of the how
everything started. Small developer user groups who usually
get together for knowledge sharing and hanging out wanted to
make something bigger. They made it a **lot** bigger with this
conference, but managed to keep the overall aura humble and
friendly. Even with that informal feeling, everything was
working, schedule was followed punctually and nothing was
missing for speakers or attendees. That's why most of the
credits should go to organizers and volunteers. And this is my
"thank you" to all of them.
