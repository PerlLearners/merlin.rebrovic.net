Last week I attended [MX conference][1] about design
organizations and leadership. It was a big opportunity for me
because I mostly attended production oriented tech and design
conferences before. The schedule was full of experienced and
notable people and all videos are [already available][2]. I
took some notes along the way and would like to share the gist
of the event. Here are five common threads starting from very
broad and narrowing it down.

## 1. Industry trends: design is important

This was a big thing, especially because [the conference
organizer was acquired by a bank][3] late last year. Although
it sounds unusual, it is not an isolated case; more and more
design agencies are joining big companies. It is a recent, but
very strong trend.

So why does this happen? It seems there is a compatible need
between two interested parties.

1. Industry doesn't see design as a cost anymore, but as an
   investment. People interact with technology every day more
   than ever before and they've become more attuned to
   quality of digital products. Big companies are aware where
   their money comes from and want to have a competitive
   advantage.
2. Design has been broadly described as "hacking behavior" and
   "making choices that trigger the right responses" by some
   speakers. As agencies mature, many want to move away from
   making pretty websites and apps to having more impact.
   Joining forces with those who have reach makes perfect
   sense for them.

KPCB has released a [Design in Tech Report][4] this March which
describes the trend and some of the reasons for this shift.

## 2. Culture: intangible and important

Culture is one of industry's buzzwords and perfect for playing
[BS bingo][5]. Nevertheless, it is very important and defines
how your team or company operates on a daily basis. Main
take-aways:

* Culture is not a method you apply. You can't just copy
  someone else's outside appearance and expect the
  same behavior. People are more complex than that.
* Early hires set the tone of the company's culture. In
  general, hiring is either the best way to maintain or
  completely destroy what you've built over the years.
* It is important how people in power behave because it sets
  the tone for others. I also [wrote about modeling
  behavior][6] earlier.
* If you're not happy in your current position or with your
  environment, ask yourself "will this company evolve" and "do
  I believe in this CEO"? If the answer is no, plan your exit.

## 3. Team politics: it's inevitable

Politics are everywhere and that's a fact of life. The bigger
the team or the company, more politics there is. If you want
to be effective in an organization, accept it and learn how to
use it. Understanding politics means understanding how people
interact with each other.

Bad politics--stabbing other people in the back--happens
because of "social threats to status, certainty, autonomy,
relatedness and fairness". This shouldn't happen if you have a
supportive culture, but even if it does, striving towards
common purpose should lessen tensions between people or teams.

Learning what the main channels of communication are is really
important, especially if you're new on the team. Conversations
should be moved where the traction is--who are stakeholders
and decision makers--because that's how ideas get implemented.

## 4. Team communication: focus on others

There have been two big themes in this area. First, building
[shared understanding][7] leads to extremely fast and effortless
communication. This, of course, leads to being more effective
and productive.

The best way to build shared understanding is to show, not
only tell. Prototyping in high or low fidelity was mentioned a
couple of times; it can and should be used in any technical
endeavor from architecture to software and service design.
Direct experience is the most powerful perspective changer.

Second, focusing on others will bring you and them more
benefits than just looking after yourself. The shift from a
traditional view of a manger to a more of mentor-like role was
discussed a lot. Manager--top-down communication, discourages
risk, gives assessments, pushes feedback. Mentor--concentrates
on growth and learning, gives advice, fosters two-way
communication and encourages risk. The name of the role will
probably stay the same, but the behavior will have to change.

Some good questions to ask:

* For prioritization "Will this matter five years from now?"
* As an enabler "How might we do/accomplish X?" in contrast to
  "It will never work."
* For finding common patterns and efforts "What do other
  people work on?"
* The most important one "How can I help you?"

## 5. Use your hands: don't forget where you started

Last, but not least, many senior and experienced people said
you should stay close to production and get your hands dirty
once in a while. As designers take more responsibility, they
often lead other designers so their communication and people
skills become more relevant than core ones. Don't let them
become obsolete; it gives you more leverage with people you
lead.
