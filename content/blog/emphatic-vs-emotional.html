    What the Oxford dictionary says about these two terms.

I'm always under the impression that many people mix being
_empathic_ and _emotional_. Oxford dictionary states:

**Empathic:**

* having the ability to understand another person's feelings,
  experience, etc.

**Emotional:**

* causing people to feel strong emotions
* (sometimes disapproving) showing strong emotions, some in a
  way that other people think is unnecessary

One can exist without the other or at least be less prominent.
A self-absorbed movie celebrity can have excessive public
displays of emotions in response to critic reviews, but have
no consideration for colleagues on a movie set, friends, or
family. On the other hand, a grandmother that lived a harsh
life dulled her emotions to cope, but can pull from that
experience to understand how people feel in complex
situations.
