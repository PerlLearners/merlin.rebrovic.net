Elon Musk--CEO of SpaceX and Tesla--was asked on a recent Ask
Me Anything on Reddit how he manages to learn so quickly,
especially since he is innovating in different industries and
is successful in all of them. [He replies][1]:

<blockquote>
    <p>I do kinda feel like my head is full! My context
    switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not
    what it used to be.</p>

    <p>Frankly, though, I think most people can learn a lot
    more than they think they can. They sell themselves short
    without trying.</p>

    <p>One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as
    sort of a semantic treeâ€”make sure you understand the
    fundamental principles, ie. the trunk and big branches,
    before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing
    for them to hang on to.</p>
</blockquote>

Let's repeat this:

1. You can do a lot more than you think you can.
2. You need a good foundation in the area you're trying to
   master. I've already [touched upon the topic][2] last year.

The [whole AMA][3] is also interesting to read if you have time.
