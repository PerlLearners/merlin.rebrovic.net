All good leaders I observed in the last couple of years share
two qualities: they don't micromanage and they push boundaries.
It doesn't matter if they're middle manager or SVP level.

It might look tempting to either decide or do something
instead of letting a colleague do it--we all love to look
smart--but that quickly turns into a nightmare as the number
of people you lead increases. Nobody wants team members who
are so dependent that they are incapable of doing anything on
their own. Instead, you want to have a framework and a mindset
in place so that they can learn, grow, and create by
themselves. A leader serves as an enabler and a guide.

Good leaders also keep everyone just outside of a comfort
zone. Sometimes it's direct and obvious, but many times it's
indirect and subtle. If a leader doesn't do that, many people
will stay in the same place forever. This reminds me of what
professor [Harold Eugene Edgerton][1] liked to say to his
students:

<blockquote>
The trick to education is to teach people in such a way that
they don't realize they're learning until it's too late.
</blockquote>
