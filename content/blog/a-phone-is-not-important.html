    A short note on my shifting attitude towards technology
    over time.
---

My attitude towards technology shifted over time. I notice I
put less emphasis on a specific brand, an operating system
maker, or a hardware manufacturer, and more on what I can
accomplish with it. It's probably a side-effect of seeing
products and services come and go over the years.

Technology is just a tool and, yes, certain tools are better
for certain jobs. But worshiping it doesn't seem right. A tool
is not the end goal; it's what I can accomplish with it.

A text editor is not important; writing a poem is.  
A camera is not important; capturing a precious moment is.  
A phone is not important; calling a friend is.
