    A simple reason why it is important to guess before

Setting hypotheses and testing them is one of the cornerstones
of science and critical thinking. People practice it outside
strict scientific fields too, but probably not as deliberately
(the always part). After thinking about this for a couple of
days, this struck me as odd because, as Professor Tadashi
Tokieda had mentioned, it is an excellent learning method.

Guessing tests assumptions, reasoning, and knowing
fundamentals. It can be used for more exact areas like
programming and engineering, but also for messier situations
like usability testing or sales meetings. The tricky part is
remembering to stop for a few seconds, step back, and ask:
"What do I expect to happen, and why?"
