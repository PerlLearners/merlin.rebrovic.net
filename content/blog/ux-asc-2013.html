[App Start Contest][1] is an educational student contest
organized on the University of Zagreb. From February to May
partners from IT industry present case studies to help
students learn from experience. Five Minutes is one of the
partners, so [Vedran Zidanik][2] and I gave two lectures.

After a short intro by Luka Abrus, it was my turn first. I
talked about good communication during a project and how to
incorporate good user experience practices in a normal
workflow. The presentation was very similar to the one from
[WebCamp Zagreb][3], so check it out if you're interested.

Vedran spoke about user interface design, specifically about
typography, grids and color. In a series of slides he
demonstrated how to improve a design of a mobile news reader.
Presented that way, with each step showing only a small
gradual change, it's easy to see how a great visual design
comes to life even for an untrained developer.

But the true heroes of this story are the organizers and
students. To manage and attend such a contest during a tough
academic year is no small feat. On the other hand, we wouldn't
expect any less from our future colleagues and partners :)
