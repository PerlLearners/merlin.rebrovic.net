We had a very rough ride that morning. Most of the passengers
on the boat had to go outside to get some fresh air and some
were looking at their breakfast for the second time. Bad
weather had brought rain, wind and big waves. It was not a
nice way to get to the Great Barrier Reef.

The Reef is the world's largest coral reef system and it spans
through 2.600 kilometres. Imagine it stretching from London to
Moscow. Huge, right? I was to dive there and the thought
itself was terrifying.

The weather subsided a bit and we received two safety
lectures. One was for being on the boat and the second one for
diving. As this was my first dive ever, my only option was an
introductory dive. It means you have to be very close to an
instructor at all times and you're allowed to go only a few
meters deep. Even after safety instructions they'll let you
dive only if you can demonstrate clearing water out from
your mask and breathing regulator.

There were a lot of people so we had to go in groups. I was
free to snorkel until they called my group. Snorkelling was
just what I needed; the water was very warm and I had time to
relax and prepare. Corals and fishes were two to three meters
deep, so they were easy to spot from the surface. The
presentation on marine wildlife earlier in the day helped us
recognize different species. It was beautiful and I already
marked my day as a success. But that was just the beginning.

_"Group seven!"_ yelled someone from the upper deck. It was my
turn. Lead weights, air tank, regulator, goggles, fins and I'm
ready. I jumped into the water on their mark, not sure what
to expect.

It's hard to explained what happened next. The first dive
ever, swimming in three dimensions, fiddling with the leaking
mask and strugling to equalize the pressure in my ears while
trying to see the wonders of the Reef. After a few minutes I
managed to stabilize and only then I started to enjoy the
wildlife. And it was _spectacular_. Corals of different color,
some solid as a rock, others with tentacles following strong
ocean currents. Fishes, all sizes and color, swimming alone or
in big schools counting hundred or more. We even had the
privilege to spot and swim with a couple of big sea turtles.
And I must say, they're cute.

As we were getting out of the water, mesmerized, the sun had
already broken through the clouds. It was the perfect closing
for the perfect experience.
