This just came in the mail. It's from ZVV, Zürich's public
transport company and it says "Danke schön für Ihre Treue"
at the top. It translates to "Thank you for your loyalty".

The attached letter says how happy they are that a new
important underground train connection between two parts of
the city will be ready during June. It will shorten the trip
to the airport by 6 minutes (you can't make this up) and they
would be delighted if we would come to the opening to do a
test ride.

The announcement packs a set of new and revised timetables,
some other minor news and a discount voucher for a trip to
popular city destinations like the zoo, museums, etc.

The public transit is well connected, affordable, punctual,
supported by online services and they still manage to delight
people with details like this. I really want to buy a ticket
here because I clearly see what I'm paying for.

_Note: I was planning to write a big review of Zürich and
Switzerland for the last two months I've been here, but it
seems I can never find a block of time large enough to finish
it. Therefore I decided to split it in a series of smaller,
but more focused posts._
