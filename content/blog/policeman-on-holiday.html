I bought <cite>[Snuff][1]</cite> today, the last Discworld
novel by Terry Pratchett. It starts with a line that is a
summary of many detective novels.

<blockquote>
It is a truth universally acknowledged that a policeman taking
a holiday would barely have had time to open his suitcase
before he finds his first corpse.
</blockquote>

After reading this and finding out the main character is
[Sam Vimes][2] and I'm sure this novel will be awesome :)
