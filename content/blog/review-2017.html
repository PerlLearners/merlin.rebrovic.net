As I was reflecting on the past year, the phrase "delicate
balance" was the only thing that came to mind. There is one
point at which opposing forces form a balance between work and
family time, between pushing yourself to the limit and taking
a break, and between being online and offline. There isn't one
correct ratio--it depends on the individual and the
environment. I found mine in 2017.

To maintain my balance, I had to reduce or completely shut
down some social media or entertainment channels. I turned
inwards and focused on education and family. I had to say 'no'
to too many things to achieve the balance, but it was worth
it--the year was rewarding. There weren't many "big" events
one would use to boast; there were a lot of small delightful
moments that make life enjoyable.

I've also spent a lot of time thinking and reading about the
world we live in, and how technology has transformed it in the
last hundred years. Each generation has lived in a
significantly different world than the previous one. Each
country and region had its own pace due to geopolitical
situation, but here's how it happened in my part of the world.

Things were a bit slow until the time of my grandparents.
Their ancestors have broken their backs on farms and have
known manure, muddy fields, and itchy hay too well.

My grandparents' generation was the first who has experienced
something groundbreaking: electricity and radio. Electricity
is taken for granted today, but that generation has witnessed
the first wires being put into place. People started to move
to a city in search of a better life after the Second World
War ended and enrolled in primary education. They were the
first in their families who owned cars. They've also
encountered antibiotics for the first time.

My parents' generation has seen indoor toilets and running
water become ubiquitous. Attending high school was expected;
university degrees were achievable and would guarantee a safe
job. TV provided a small window into the vast world. Home
telephones made communication easier. The first computers in
companies were big as rooms, and the news was that in some far
away countries computers were connected in a network. People
landed on the moon.

My generation has grown up with personal computers and the
World Wide Web. The new digital space had been just a big
experiment at first, but soon it became indispensable. Mobile
phones led and smartphones followed in one of the most
significant transformations in human history that provided
personal computing to billions of people. Education was still
important, but it's much easier to go around formal
institutions and find excellent resources online.

My kid's generation is born into yet another world. Machines
are surpassing some human intellectual abilities. Driving
licenses might become obsolete because cars drive themselves.
Space rockets are landing, not crashing to Earth.
Biotechnology is sprinting towards personalized medicine.
Formal education and law are lagging and scrambling to stay up
to date. It's hard to imagine what will be invented in ten or
twenty years from now.

This incredible technological progress continues to
accelerate. The fear of being left behind is a constant
pressure on the delicate balance between trying to keep up and
taking a break. I feel that pressure every day, but I hope
that the year 2018 is going to be same as the
previous--rewarding and balanced.
