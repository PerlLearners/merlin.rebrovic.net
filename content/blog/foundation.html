I stumbled upon this great video recently by YouTube user
Sycra. He talks about different drawing styles while sketching
at the same time. I urge you to watch the first five minutes
as an intro, if for no other reason than to see the
unbelievable ease with which he draws different faces.

Fascinating, right? What's really profound here is the
message: styles are not very important, foundation is. If you
have that, you can draw in any style you want. "Foundation"
means core skills, domain knowledge and underlying principles.
It's different for every human endeavor and a great divider
between beginners and masters.

Some clients asked me what my style was. I didn't know what to
answer because I use different styles all the time. A
children's mobile game will have a very different style than a
corporate website. Designer's foundation is knowing colors,
typography, human psychology, digital media, etc. When you
have that it's much easier to explore and find the best
possible solution. Locking yourself to one style and applying
it to many different problems is bad design.

Programming is similar. Languages (syntax), programming
paradigms (functional, procedural, OO) and frameworks are
styles. Hardware and software interoperability, algorithms,
data structures, abstractions and other principles are
programmer's foundation.

Tango, salsa, jive, ballet, contemporary are just dancing
styles. Rhythm, motor coordination, understanding of music,
speed and flexibility are dancer's foundation.

Learn the foundations in any area and you won't be a slave to
styles and trends. You will be free to explore, adapt and
innovate. I'll leave you with something to think about --
