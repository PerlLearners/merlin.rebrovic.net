I tried calligraphy for the first time today and it was
wonderful. As with all new skills, it felt awkward and almost
unattainable at first. After practicing for a couple of hours,
I could write all letters of the alphabet and some simple
words. First milestone reached.

Now, with all tools ready and basics learned, the path to
mastery is clear: just put years of deliberate practice into it.
