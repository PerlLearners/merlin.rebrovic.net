I found it interesting that there were a few presentations at
UX London with what seemed as conflicting views of how a UX
workflow should unfold. [Jeff Gothelf](https://twitter.com/jboogie)
was in favor of testing assumptions with his Lean UX approach
as soon as possible. He mentioned a case where they used
wireframes and PDF prototypes to check if an idea and a
potential solution made sense before writing one line of code.
On the other hand, [Ben Terrett](https://twitter.com/benterrett)
from fascinating gov.uk team says they sketch a bit and then
jump directly to coding in the browser.

My mind immediately started to evaluate which one was better.
It seems this is a normal human behaviour when presented with
two options. It took me a few days before my mind settled on
another one - they both work, but under different
circumstances. Let me explain that a bit.

To build something a target audience would like and use, there
has to be a _shared understanding_ between team members and
future customers. Unfortunately, that's usually not the case.
The whole process, from defining goals, discovery, specs,
wireframes to final design and implementation, serves as a way
to coordinate everyone, get their visions aligned, test ideas
and then build it. I look at the whole process as a staircase,
each step bringing you closer to your goals. The steps are not
important; getting on the next floor is.

Framed that way, it's easy to find situations where it's OK to
skip a few steps. If goals are well defined and tested, a team
works together for a long time or there aren't a lot of
stakeholders that need reporting or explaining, it's very
likely there is a high level of _shared understanding_
already. If a designer and a developer know exactly what to
build and how it should look like, there are no good reasons
for a designer to spend time sketching wireframes he'll use to
explain something everyone already knows.

Ideally, one would need only a few steps to reach a goal. But
as a project gets bigger, riskier or with more people
involved, don't be afraid to add more steps. If you try to
jump over too many of them in the dark, you'll slip.
