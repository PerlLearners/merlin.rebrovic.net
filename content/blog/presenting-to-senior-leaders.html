{% mark excerpt %}
Many people are passionate about their craft. They spend most
of their working time in deep focus fretting about perfection.
At times they need to present their work to senior leaders who
think more about long-term strategy. I've sat through many
meetings and witnessed a complete mismatch between those two
worlds. Craftswomen and craftsmen often dive into technical
details because they want to show complexity or how they've
elegantly solved a problem. However, those things are not
relevant to senior leaders who usually get lost in minutiae.

I've stumbled in the same way before, but was fortunate to
work with people who mentored me on how to adjust to a
different audience. It's not hard. You just have to ask
yourself one question: what do senior leaders wonder?

* Why are we doing this?
* What are expected benefits?
* When is it happening?
* What do you need from us (resources, dependency on other
  teams, and similar)?
* Is there an impact on other projects or teams?
* Is there an overlap with other teams?

If you follow these steps, you'll nail the presentation
every time.
