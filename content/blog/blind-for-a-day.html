{% mark excerpt %}
The smell of scrambled eggs filled the kitchen. I was
starving, and it felt like torture. The creamy eggs hit the
plate soon; I was ready. I grabbed a fork and stabbed at them.
"I got it," I thought to myself. I lifted a fork to my mouth
anticipating the first contact with a smile. And then I bit
the metal. That can happen when you're blind.

## Beginning

I'm a nerd and I make lists. Some last a day, some a bit
longer. There is one that is a decade old; it contains an
entry "be blind for a day." It's from a time I first got
interested in human psychology and especially how a human
brain works--how it learns and how it adapts. Will my
perception drastically change?  Will I adjust to new
surroundings quickly or fail miserably? How is my environment
prepared for my new state? Will I gain even more empathy for
people with eyesight problems? A lot of questions formed in my
mind.
{% endmark %}

But the answer never came. There were some logistics to it,
and I had to find free time, but that combination rarely
happened. Years passed, and a lot of things happened without
crossing the entry.

Then last November I was flying from New York and wore a
sleeping mask for a couple of hours. It pressed my eyeballs
and blurred my vision for almost three hours after removing
it. Instead of being angry about my predicament, I set out to
explore everything around me and my behavior in that state. It
was informative while it lasted and I wanted to do more.
Following that flight I tried to find a sweet spot one weekend
and decided I'll do it from Jan 17 evening to Jan 18
afternoon.

## Preparation

{{ macros.external_image("2015-01-29_blindfolded.jpg",
"I'm wearing a bandana over my eyes.") }}

There were a lot of things I wanted to try but had to limit
myself to what's possible in 24 hours. I knew I would need
assistance the whole time, so I had to free my and my wife's
schedule. I also wanted to go outside, so the weather should
be nice too. Having the sun show its face would be a bonus
because I could wear sunglasses and not look too weird.

Since I'm currently working as an interaction designer, I'm
trying to be sensitive to how current technology impacts
people with impairments. _Mobile_ is the word of the day,
and I decided to use my smartphone for exploring the digital
world.

I left other things as they were. I didn't explore how
visually impaired people solve common problems and wanted to
encounter them with a fresh perspective. That made some things
harder, but also more innocent.

Most experiences intertwined together, but I won't write in a
journal format because that might be too chaotic to follow. I
shall group my experiences in different categories as I think
this will give a better impression of how it felt.

* Housekeeping and clothing
* Orienting inside
* Preparing meals and eating
* Hygiene
* Entertainment
* The digital world
* The outside world

## Housekeeping and clothing

This is where I started. Folding shirts was not as hard as
I thought, although I would change my folding style to
something less visually dependent if the blind state persisted.

{{ macros.external_figure("2015-01-29_folded_shirts.jpg",
"I won't get any awards for this, but it will fit into our
closet.") }}

Matching socks was an interesting one. It's both easy and hard
at the same time. Easy, because there are so many telling
clues: fabric thickness, length, elasticity, fabric patterns.
I correctly identified each and every pair (type). The hard
part is pulling them from a heap and remembering where I put
each one before finding a match. The same type of socks, but
in different colors--no luck there.

I got dressed so many times in my life that I can do it
blindfolded (pun intended). Matching colors of my shirts
wasn't a worry at all and other garments I could identify just
by touching them. An critical thing was to return clothes to
their proper place or somewhere where I won't forget. If I
tossed them around recklessly, it would be very hard and
time-consuming to find them again.

{{ macros.external_figure("2015-01-29_changing_trash_bags.jpg",
"Changing trash bags was easy and quick, especially because I
wasn't afraid sticking my fingers in some leftovers.") }}

## Orienting inside

I'm in my apartment so I should be OK, right? Sort of. I know
where everything is approximately, but not exactly. For
example, is the distance from one room to the kitchen three or
five steps across the hallway? Are door frames five
centimeters higher or shorter than I am? These don't sound
like critical questions, but when one outcome is smashing my
face against a wall, priorities change.

That's why I noticed my posture deteriorating over time. I
bent over too much, walked slowly and always traced my way
around with a hand against a wall. I was feeling the constant
anxiety of hitting things. It got better over time, but there
were critical times when the feeling returned. For example,
after waking up.

## Preparing meals and eating

Food was the unpleasant surprise of the whole experiment, and
that was a surprise by itself. I was completely unaware how
much visual input I use for food preparation and eating.

I tried to eat different types of meals and prepare some of
them. Eggs from the start of this article were the first step.
Getting everything from the fridge, breaking and scrambling
eggs was not a big problem, although it was a bit messy.

{{ macros.external_image("2015-01-29_breaking_eggs.jpg",
"Image description.") }}

The first hurdle I couldn't jump over was using our stove. It
has a completely flat glass-ceramic cooktop and no safe way to
test where I need to put the pan. No touching or probing with
my fingers. I've tried to guess the right position of the pan
and it was partially overlapping with the cooking ring. I
decided we don't need a fire hazard that evening and left the
dinner to my wife.

{{ macros.external_image("2015-01-29_pan_on_stove.jpg",
"Image description.") }}

OK, at least eating won't be a problem. Ha! First
mistake--using a flat plate and a fork. Eggs are so soft and
light I had no idea if I picked something up. And spreading
the eggs all over the plate wasn't helping me determine if I
have leftovers or am I finished. We humans have some amazing
tools with delicate sensors--our fingers. That's how I
finished my dinner.

{{ macros.external_image("2015-01-29_eating_eggs_with_hands.jpg",
"Image description.") }}

I know a simple trick for pouring liquids when you're in the
dark. Just put a thumb inside a cup and pour until you feel
the liquid on the tip of the finger. Warning: do not try it
with boiling water for obvious reasons.

{{ macros.external_image("2015-01-29_pouring_liquids.jpg",
"Image description.") }}

My favorite breakfast in the morning--bread, butter, and jam. I
knew spreading butter and jam would be a challenge because I
will have no idea what I picked up with my knife and where I
spread it on a loaf of bread. It went reasonably well with
some loafs looking very good and others looking like butcher's
victims.

{{ macros.external_image("2015-01-29_bread_butter_jam.jpg",
"Eating bread, butter and jam.") }}

I have two takeaways from this meal:

1. It's extremely helpful to say out loud where things are
   when setting up a table. Same should happen if something is
   moved or being used. Tracking many things in this way
   wasn't a problem if I knew what was going on.
2. I wasn't as fast using cutlery as before, so the whole
   meal took longer. As a consequence, I felt full earlier and
   ate less food overall.

The last meal while blindfolded was lunch; my wife prepared a
casserole with rice and vegetables. I was ready this time; I
used a small bowl and a spoon. That way food doesn't fall out
and always gravitates toward the middle. Easy, effective, and
I can enjoy the meal, not fight invisible demons.

Food is hard and it got me interested; I'll have to explore it
a bit more. I'm sure it's easier with some practice and proper
preparation. A quick search landed me on this funny and short
video about how blind people cook when alone.

{{ macros.embed_video("umiOuVA7PEc", "YouTube") }}

## Hygiene

Hygiene is easy as clothing. I've been doing this for a very
long time every day, and almost all is based on touch.

There was one awkward moment. After finishing number two, how
should I know when to stop wiping? I couldn't bear the
uncertainty, so I immediately jumped under a shower.

{{ macros.external_figure("2015-01-29_washing_hands.jpg",
"Everyone can wash their hands blindfolded.") }}

## Entertainment

Trying out different things in such a short day didn't leave
too much time for entertainment. I first tried audiobooks, but
I've been doing that for quite some time now so it wasn't
anything new.

I also tried to "watch" videos. Conversation and plot based
storylines I could track without many problems, but action or
other visual scenes were just random noise. To be honest, I
would have to think what else to do if I had more time;
everything that quickly comes to mind is visual.

## The digital world

This is where it gets fascinating. I was torn between
what's possible and what's annoying that I'm still thinking
about it daily. I enabled [Talkback][1] on my Android phone. It
provides spoken, audible and vibration feedback when something
is touched. When an item is selected, just double tap anywhere
to activate it. Talkback also provides some global gestures
that invoke reading speed menus and quick navigation.

{{ macros.external_figure("2015-01-29_android_apps.jpg",
"With an accessibility mode enabled, tapping something selects
an item and reads its contents aloud. Double tap activates
it.") }}

The experiment starts with sheer fascination. I'm blind and
can operate a piece of flat glass that provides mostly visual
feedback. If that isn't wonderful, I don't know what is. Yes,
I'm slow. I'm exploring a lot. Sometimes I'm completely lost
and need to start from the beginning. But the tireless
synthetic voice of the accessibility assistant always tries to
lead me where I want to go.

{{ macros.external_figure("2015-01-29_listening_to_talkback.jpg",
"Yes, it's possible to navigate the digital world in this
way.") }}

And I've been places. Messaging, browsing, reading--or better,
listening to--articles, taking notes. I even browsed Twitter
and posted a message. What at the time seemed like another no
context thought to others was actually me blindly tapping a
piece of glass. And believe me, I worked hard for it. 

{{ macros.embed_tweet("There's more to this tweet than it seems.",
"merlinrebrovic", "556524348174254082", "2015-01-17") }}

[Voice search and input][2] were extremely helpful, but that
didn't come as a surprise. One thing that did is when the
power button is pressed and screen turns on, the time is read
out loud. I didn't have to unlock the phone or anything, I
just pressed the button and immediately knew what time it is.

There were many good things, but also too many that need
improvement. I'll list a couple of them, but as a disclaimer,
I'm confident some of them could be solved with more tinkering
in the settings.

* "OK Google" phrase that triggers voice search doesn't work
  when Talkback is turned on. It doesn't make any sense,
  because that's when I need it the most.
* Accessibility software overwrites some gestures. For
  example, to go to the next item in a list, I had to swipe
  down. But that's also how I access my notifications, so I
  haven't been able to interact with them during the whole
  time.
* Talkback works everywhere. This seems like a good thing, but
  it also works WHILE was using voice input. In other words,
  it was reading back to me what I was speaking to it at the
  same time. Confusing and unusable.
* The only breakdown I had was in the morning. The alarm went
  off and I couldn't dismiss it. It kept ringing and my "swipe
  to dismiss" action was overridden with something else,
  something more "accessible". After a couple of minutes of
  trying, I had to put it in a drawer in another room until it
  died down. On the other hand, it got us fully awake.

{{ macros.external_figure("2015-01-29_android_quick_menu.jpg",
"Doing a specific gesture on a screen opens one of the quick
menus.") }}

With all these problems, I'm still fascinated I was able to
use a smartphone on multiple occasions. I'm missing some extra
buttons, though. I remember I had an extra button on my old
Windows Mobile device to which I could assign any action. When
pressed, it would record audio and save it as a note. Taking
quick notes blindfolded and through touch is neither quick nor
easy, and having dedicated hardware would help.

Oh yeah, one last thing. If the only feedback from a charging
device is a tiny LED, how will a blind person know it's
working?

## The outside world

Everything I described until now was done in a safe place,
inside my home, but I needed to get out at some point. In
short, it was terrifying.

The plan was to walk to the closest train station, ride to the
city center, do some errands, walk around and get back home.
It took a couple of hours to do everything although it seemed
a lot shorter.

{{ macros.external_image("2015-01-29_train_ride.jpg",
"Riding in a train.") }}

My wife was my walking partner, and she was always close to me
with an arm interlocked with mine. That way I couldn't wander
out to the street, and she could quickly stop me if something
suddenly changed. At first, we had some coordination issues
because everything was new to us. We knew communication was
important, but what to say and, more importantly, when to say
it was leading to some slips and head bumps. We synced in
about 15 to 20 minutes and then everything was much easier.

It is important to note that my senses didn't become any
sharper in 24 hours, I was just more aware that they also
provide input. I recognized more sounds, like distant people
chatting, turning newspapers, smartphones ringing, enthusiasts
rowing on a river, bird wings flapping. It wasn't only the
source of sounds, but how they spread that provided
information. Using that, I could determine if I was in a
hallway, a big room or out in the open.

{{ macros.external_figure("2015-01-29_facing_the_city.jpg",
"Zürich might be a beautiful city, but I didn't see any of it
that day. Instead, I enjoyed its bustling sounds and the
warmth of the sun.") }}

I used my skin to gauge sun's direction; the sunny side is
significantly warmer. Walking near stores or cafés, I could
smell coffee and groceries. Sometimes people didn't have any
smell and sometimes they had a strong body or cigarette odor.
That's an interesting thought; not to judge people by their
looks, but by how they smell and sound.

It was hard for me to track where I was. My mental map is
visual, and it's not easy to connect those two worlds. If I
were blind from birth, my mental maps would look completely
different. I caught myself daydreaming at one point and I
completely lost track of where I was.

My wife would often say "Look at that" to which we both
laughed. After some time, she just started to explain what she
was seeing and that made a huge difference to how I perceived
the environment around me. Suddenly everything had more sense,
and I could connect "random" sounds to what was going on.

Walking around a town reminded me of one Terry Pratchett's
Discworld novel with Sam Vimes, a police officer. Someone
blindfolded him and led him to a secret hideout. He knew the
streets so well he could later retrace the walk just by
feeling different surfaces under his shoes and counting steps.
I wouldn't be able to do that, but I was certainly more aware
of what I'm walking on.

After being out in the open for a couple of hours, I admire
blind people and their ability to commute daily even more.

## Final thoughts

Of the things that didn't fit into any of the above
categories, I would just mention that I was somewhat tired and
had no sense of time. I suspect not being exposed to light was
the culprit; that's probably why many blind people have
[sleeping disorders][3].

This whole experiment was a worthy experience. I'm a bit sad I
didn't do it earlier, but better now then never. If you have
time to try something similar, I heartily recommend it.

So, after all this, did I make you wonder what else is on my
ten year list? ;)
