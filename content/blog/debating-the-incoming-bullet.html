    Most of the time, not only do leaders of floundering

An interesting observation of an organizational resistance to
change from a [Moments of Impact][1] book:

> Most of the time, not only do leaders of floundering
> organizations see the bullet coming--they can't stop talking
> about it. They sit through endless presentations on the
> bullet's velocity, force, and trajectory. As it gets closer,
> bullet initiatives and shield task forces pop up all over
> the place. By the time the bullet arrives, everyone knows
> all about it--so much so that they're bored of the topic.
> Yet, they let it hit them anyway.
