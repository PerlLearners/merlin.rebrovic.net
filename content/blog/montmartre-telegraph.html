"An old telegraph in France used a mechanical semaphore on
top of the tower to signal letters according to the Chappe
system. Nearby stations would observe it and relay it further.") }}

People, companies, and governments downplaying new technology
and being left behind is nothing new. Here is an example on
early mechanical telegraphy and semaphores from the first half
of the nineteenth century, as described by James Gleick in his
excellent book _The Information_:

It has happened before, it's happening now, and it will happen
in the future. As much as history is a good teacher, we never
learn from it.
