From _The Man Who Lied to His Laptop_ by Clifford Nass and
Corina Yen:

> Ironically, while companies focused on team-building
> exercises spend enormous sums of money in the belief that
> team formation requires special locations and tremendous
> effort, social scientists have found ways to reliably create
> teams out of randomly selected people in a very short time.
> What are the secret ingredients in the social scientists'
> "special sauce"? **Identification** and **interdependence**. 
>
> The idea behind **identification** is that personality
> similarity is not the only means of bonding.
> Similarity-attraction, probably the most well-established
> principle in all of social psychology, dictates that you
> will feel bonded with anyone who is similar to you on almost
> any dimension. Thus, when team members share one or more
> characteristics that they generally do not share with those
> outside the group, it cements the group together.
>
> Along with identification, the other key factor for creating
> a sense of team is establishing **interdependence**. To
> create interdependence, research suggests that team members
> must share two beliefs. First, they must feel that achieving
> the group's goals will also serve their own personal goals.
> Second, team members are integral to the success of the
> team.
