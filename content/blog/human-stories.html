I don't remember when I, a shy kid in love with computers,
became interested in human stories. The more I think about it,
the more this transition blurs. But there it isâ€”I love hearing
stories. It turns out that most people do.
 
I tune into [The Moth Radio Hour][1] for a weekly dose of
storytelling. Even though many stories are witty and fun,
there are those that explore the darker side of life: poverty,
crime, broken marriages, battling with diseases, a death of a
child. Those stories are from ordinary people in extraordinary
circumstances, and they help me look beyond my bubble and
learn something new about the world. Sometimes I laugh,
sometimes I cry.
 
Last year [I wrote about stereotyping and jumping to
conclusions][2], and about an exercise anyone can do to reduce
bias. Hearing a lot of different stories makes the exercise
easier.
 
I highly recommend subscribing to [The Moth podcast][3]. Other
similar formats I've heard about, but haven't tried out yet:
[StoryCorps][4] ([TED talk][5]) and [Humans of New York][6].
