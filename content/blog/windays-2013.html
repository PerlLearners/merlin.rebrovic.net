From 22nd to 25th of April, Umag became the hometown of the
biggest technology conference in Croatia - Windays13. More
than a thousand people interested in Microsoft's technologies
attended, from system administrators and software developers
to project managers. I had a privilege to hold a lecture about
user experience and design.

Originally, the presentation was in Croatian with two hands-on
demos. I translated it to English and added a few new slides
from the demos to give it a bit more context. That way it's
much more accessible when viewed online.
