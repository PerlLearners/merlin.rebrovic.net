<blockquote>
"The last man on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock

If you stop for a moment and try to see what's going on in
your head, there is a big chance you're thinking "How is that
possible? Was there a disease outbreak or a nuclear war?
Maybe he's not the last human. Maybe it's aliens? Or is he
just dreaming?"

Those few sentences left a gap which your brain is trying to
fill. Humans excel at recognizing patterns and filling in
the gaps. We were doing that before we could speak and it's
automatic and very powerful. The main reason we fill in the
gaps between seemingly unrelated data is to construct meaning;
we like to know how something is related or connected to
something else.

If we see a person running in plain clothes and then a bank in
commotion surrounded by police, we'll probably suspect that
person had something to do with it. The moment we casually
connect a set of events with a meaning, we've created a story.

We tell stories to ourselves all the time to explain how or
why something happened. Sometimes they get shared and spread
among families, friends and professional communities. They
are so pervasive we cease to notice them as such.

You can be sure of one thing -- a story will always be told and
if you don't provide meaning, people will provide their own.

What is a story
---------------
One very good definition of a story I've found:

<blockquote>
A story is the telling of an event, either true or fictional,
in such a way that the receiver experiences or learns
something just by the fact that he or she heard the story. A
story is a means of transferring information, experience,
attitude or point of view.<br>
&mdash; <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/movies/blog-post/what-story-and-where-does-it-come-32636/">Source</a>
</blockquote>

Two things are worth repeating:

1. The receiver experiences or learns something.
2. A means of transferring information.

Storytelling isn't just about consumer marketing, children
stories or coming up with a plot for a novel. It can be also
used to frame our existing professional communication to make
it more effective. Good communication is an essential part of
successful projects and stories are building blocks of
communication.

For a story to be good, it has to be:

1. Truthful
-----------
If you're describing past or current events, everything you
say has to be true -- all data, references, quotes. If someone
finds only one mistake, you'll probably lose all credibility,
even if everything else is true.

2. Irresistible
---------------
We are drawn to conflicts and problems that are going towards
resolution. For example conflicts like human vs. nature, human
vs. self, human vs. other human.

For example, if you say _"We decided to redesign our web
shop."_ and continue with steps you've taken, you'll leave a
lot of people without context and reasons for the action. But
if you describe a problem _"We were losing sales because
people were not able to access our web shop with mobile
devices so we decided to redesign it"_, you'll make your
process more compelling and people will want to hear the
results and lessons learned.

3. Relevant
-----------
A story will resonate with us the most if it's already close
to our personal beliefs and cultural norms. We like to think
of ourselves as rational beings, but we're often not acting
the part. Many studies have shown that if a new fact arises
and is too far away from our current beliefs, we'll usually
try to dismiss it or at least lessen its importance.

Ed Catmull, currently the president of Pixar and Walt Disney
Animation Studios, writes in his excellent Creativity, Inc
book about a time when he worked with George Lucas on Star
Wars. At George's request, Ed's team developed a video-editing
system that would enable editors to do their work on the
computer. Have in mind that was the end of 70s.

<blockquote>
While George wanted this new video-editing system in place,
the film editors at Lucasfilm did not. They were perfectly
happy with the system they had already mastered, which
involved actually cutting film into snippets with razor blades
and then pasting them back together.<br>
...<br>
They took comfort in their familiar ways and change meant
being uncomfortable. So when it came time to test our work,
the editors refused to participate. Our certainty that video
editing would revolutionize the process didn't matter, and
neither did George's backing. Because the people our new
system was intended to serve were resistant to it, progress
screeched to a halt.
</blockquote>

And here is the lesson:

<blockquote>
Clearly, it wasn't enough for managers to have good
ideas--they had to be able to engender support for those ideas
among the people who'd be charged with employing them. I took
that lesson to heart.
</blockquote>

This means you have to prepare or adapt a story for a specific
audience. One story for all just won't work.

Take a small cherry tree as an analogy. Cherries at the bottom
are easy to pick; they'll be gone immediately. The ones at the
top will never be picked, except maybe by birds. Cherries in
the middle are hard to reach even if people stretch. Your job
as a storyteller is to lower the branch so it's easier for
them to grab the cherries.

When a story is relevant to listeners, it's not only a
speaker's story anymore. It becomes their shared story.

{{ macros.external_image("foo_shared_story.jpg",
"A speaker's story becomes a shared story between listeners.") }}

Now you know what makes a good story, so let's go through a
couple of examples and apply it. Unless you've just started in
the field, you know drawing interfaces and writing code is
only a small part of the whole start-to-end process. It
involves defining problems, researching, talking to
stakeholders, outlining and presenting solutions,
collaborating, building a team and keeping it motivated.

Hiring
------
Imagine you're applying for a senior position in a small or
medium sized company. You're going to talk to a project
manager, company co-founder or CTO. After initial pleasantries
and introduction, there comes the best and the worst question
in the world: "Tell me something about yourself." You can
answer with a list like this:

* PhD Computer Science
* 10y C++, 3y Python
* Certificate A, Certificate B
* Leadership skills

But what did you actually say about yourself? That you stayed
long in academia and that you probably know something about
C++? Is that what you wanted to say? Let's take good story
principles from earlier and apply them here. One that is
obviously missing is relevance. You have to think from the
perspective of a person who is building a business. What does
he or she want from a senior person? To be proactive, find and
solve problems, be an example to others and be able to learn
and grow.

So in light of that, let's try to rephrase the opening
paragraph of our answer and lead the following discussion in a
more interesting direction.

<blockquote>
Led a team of 10 engineers to build a product based on my
PhD which earned $5M in profits just last quarter.
</blockquote>

Under a condition it's true, you have their complete attention.

Laszlo Bock, SVP of People Operations at Google, recently
wrote a post [My personal formula for a winning
resume][formula] in which he describes just this kind of
approach of starting your first professional communication
with a potential employer.

Presenting to stakeholders
--------------------------
{{ macros.external_image("foo_presenting.jpg",
"People talking in front of some mocks.") }}

A similar approach works perfectly for presenting to
stakeholders. Putting your work in front of them without any
explanation will force them to come with their own reasoning
why it should or shouldn't work. But if you create a story
that is relevant for them, where you explain how your
solution is going to solve their problem, then they'll be
more likely to accept it and go forward with it.

Mike Monteiro lists [13 ways designers screw up client
presentations][screwup]; try to see if you're doing some of
these mistakes. Mike sees presenting in a similar way:

<blockquote>
So when presenting the work, talk about it in terms that
relate to their business. Talk about how the decisions you
made as the design expert match up to the goals of the
project. Then your client can judge those as the subject
matter they are.
</blockquote>

User stories
------------
Depending on your design and development process, you could
take a long flow and create a number of smaller user stories
often used in agile environments.

    As a [user role]
    I want to [accomplish something]
    So that [some benefit happens]

These smaller stories usually have a couple of acceptance
criteria and if everything is kept on a higher level, it can
be checked and validated by stakeholders, project managers,
engineers and testers at any time during development.

Culture
-------

One place where storytelling really shines is building a team
or company culture. It's a tricky subject because people
usually assume it's only happening in one direction, from top
to bottom, but it's also from bottom to top and peer to peer. 

Storytelling is a daily activity in a team and one person
can't control it; people will always talk about what's
happening or what other people are doing. But you can do two
things to influence it:

1. Create environments where good things happen so people want
   to tell positive stories. That's the hard part.
2. When stories like that happen, try to give them a better
   form and perpetuate them for the future. Good stories tend
   to stick and over time they will influence decisions,
   attitude and morale of other people.

[Zappos][] is world famous for their customer service. When
they hire a customer representative, they prefer people
without experience so they can train them in a way which
follows their culture. Some of the calls they get and operator
responses are legendary.

For example, they don't measure customer support success by
how short and efficient calls are. They try to solve your
problem in any way and build a relationship. The longest call
to date was 10 hours and 29 minutes on Dec 8, 2012.

By repeating stories like that Zappos shows to all employees
that it's OK to act like that. It also helps guiding new hires
and setting standards. You can read a lot more of this stories
if you [search for "Zappos customer service
stories"][zappos_stories].

Different media
---------------
Stories come in many forms. They are usually thought of in a
written or spoken form, but they can be charts, videos,
photos, comics. Basically anything that transfers an
information or emotion.

Explaining in writing what an enormous engineering feat is to
move a building is hard, but only one photo completely changes
the perspective.

"Moving a building on a set of rails.") }}

It's similar way, [xkcd][] explains how online star ratings
work in just one image.

The story ends
--------------
Storytelling is a way people communicate and it's not going
anywhere. Stories are powerful, effective and influence people
in a profound way. They are just a tool, so you have to be
responsible and use them to do good. And with that, I
encourage you to try to think in terms of stories to frame
your problems or intentions better.
