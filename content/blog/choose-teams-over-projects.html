    Choose teams over projects and don't judge a company from
    just one team.

{% mark excerpt %}
People often ask me, "How do you like working in a big
company?" and I always answer, "I like working with my current
team." The look I get back reveals that people think I'm
hiding something. I'm not. It's just that I'm not comfortable
projecting relationships and attitudes of my closest twenty
colleagues to tens of thousands other employees across the
world.

Very small companies usually have only one teamâ€”the company
itself. As businesses grow, multiple teams have to form. Even
though teams try to follow the culture of the whole company,
each team has its own mini-culture and dynamics that are
shaped by its leaders, members, environment, and goals. Two
teams can sometimes be so different that it's hard to imagine
them being related in any way.

People far removed from a particular team, usually outside of
a company, are sometimes quick to judge the whole company by
actions or deliverables of that team. This is ungrounded. It's
like saying a whole class is excellent by observing the
performance of only one student. The class might be excellent
or it might be horrible, but you can't tell from only one
case.

I've always valued working with good people more than working
on a good project. When switching projects or teams, I try to
find out as much as possible about people with whom I'll spend
most of my waking time. Projects come and go; human
relationships last much longer.
