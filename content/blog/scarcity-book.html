I finished a book _[Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So
Much][1]_ by Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir. The
premise of their research is that experiencing any kind of
scarcity negatively affects our lives and communities. While
this seems intuitive, it touches so many organizational
situations and human conditions that I was left genuinely
surprised.

What is scarcity
----------------
Being short on money is what immediately comes to mind. It's
a very common one, but far from the only type of scarcity.

* Dieters have to constantly watch over a limited number of
  calories.
* Constant noise and interruptions make concentration and
  focus scarce. Think noisy offices and gadget notifications.
* Lonely people are missing affection and attention.
* Sleep deprivation.
* Busy people are struggling to find more time, but never seem
  to succeed.

The consequences of scarcity are really disturbing:

<blockquote>
... a school in New Haven was located next to a noisy railroad
line. To measure the impact of this noise on academic
performance, two researchers noted that only one side of the
school faced the tracks, so the students in classrooms on that
side were particularly exposed to the noise but were otherwise
similar to their fellow students. They found a striking
difference between the two sides of the school. Sixth graders
on the train side were a full year behind their counterparts
on the quieter side. Further evidence came when the city,
prompted by this study, installed noise pads. The researchers
found that this erased the difference: now students on both
sides of the building performed at the same level. A whole
host of subsequent studies have shown that noise can hurt
concentration and performance. Even if the impact of noise
does not surprise you, the size of the impact (a full school
year level at sixth grade) should.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
We found that farmers performed much worse before harvest than
after harvest. The same farmer fared worse on fluid
intelligence and executive control when he was poor
(preharvest) than when he was rich (postharvest).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Dieters, when doing anything, should find they have fewer
mental resources because they are partly preoccupied with
food.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Scarcity doesn’t just lead us to overborrow or to fail to
invest. It leaves us handicapped in other aspects of our
lives. It makes us dumber. It makes us more impulsive. We must
get by with less mind available, with less fluid intelligence
and with diminished executive control—making life that much
harder.

"Acording to the authors, farmers display very different

To use authors' wording, poor people are not necessarily poor
because they're dumb, but they can be dumb because they're
poor. It's a vicious cycle that makes it very hard to escape.

This doesn't happen only to "other" people; it can happen to
everyone and that's why it's so dangerous. Researchers took a
group and randomly split it in two. Some people were assigned
to poor and others to rich participants. "The poor" showed
behavior described here and "the rich" prospered, even though
all were in the same socio-economic situation hours earlier.

Slack
-----
Handling scarcity is much easier if a person has slack. Slack
can be a lot of different things:

* A rainy day fund in a bank.
* Allowing more time between travel segments or business
  meetings.
* A busy executive having an assistant on-call to help with
  unexpected changes and interruptions.

Slack allows us ease of mind and, unexpectedly, better
performance in the long run. If there is no slack and scarcity
is not self-imposed, it becomes poverty.

<blockquote>
<p>Dieters can take a break from their diet. The busy can take
vacations. One cannot take a vacation from poverty. Simply
deciding not to be poor&mdash;even for a bit&mdash;is never an
option.</p>
<p>This discussion clarifies what we mean by poverty. We mean
cases of economic scarcity where changing what you want, or
think you need, is simply not viable.</p>
</blockquote>

There is a poverty example for dieters too. If a person is
suffering from a medical condition that limits what the
person can eat, it's also not an option to stop.

Borrowing
---------
Borrowing by itself is not bad, but the ones who need it the
most are usually not in the right frame of mind to make a good
and informed decision about it.

<blockquote>
In fact, as far as personality traits go these people are
anything but myopic; rather, it is the context of scarcity
that makes us all act that way. Tunnels limit everyone’s
vision.
</blockquote>

And to make matters worse, humans in general are terrible at
valuation over long periods of time. We overvalue immediate
benefits at the expense of future ones: this is why it's hard
to save, to got to the gym or do your school assignments
early.

The book provides more examples of borrowing money and adverse
consequences of it, but another issue grabbed my attention.
It's probably one of the biggest problems in our
industry--technical debt.

<blockquote>
When working to finish things quickly, the engineers tunneled.
Inside their tunnel, a quick fix was just the thing needed.
Cutting corners was the perfect solution; the cost would only
show up later. Much like an expensive loan, a hastily patched
solution looks attractive within the tunnel. It saves us
something today even as it creates greater expenses in the
future.
</blockquote>

This often happens because resources were poorly allocated:

<blockquote>
As one manager puts it: “If you look at our resource
allocation on traditional projects, we always start late and
don’t put people on the projects soon enough … then we load as
many people on as it takes … the resource allocation peaks
when we launch the project.” Based on their years of study,
the researchers conclude, “There are few images more common in
current discussions of R&amp;D management than that of the
overworked engineering team putting in long hours to complete
a project in its last days before launch.” Firefighting does
not just lead to errors; it leads to a very predictable kind
of error: important but non urgent tasks are neglected.
</blockquote>

Is all hope lost?
-----------------
No, it's not. Dissecting and understanding a problem is the
first step in solving it. The authors provide some ideas and
directions how their findings can help with organizational and
global issues. Most of them would be categorized as common
sense, but they often have a twist that makes them really
effective.

<blockquote>
Consider the following thought experiment. In an attempt to
curb predatory lending, one state forces payday lenders to
charge lower fees—say, $25 instead of $50 on a $200 loan.
Assume the industry remains profitable and survives. In
another state, a different program is created: fees remain at
$50, but only $25 goes to the lender; the remaining $25 goes
into an account in the borrower’s name. Once $200 has been
accumulated in this account—in this case, after eight
loans—the person no longer needs to borrow. When she needs a
loan, she can use these savings instead. In effect, by saving
$25 of every $50 they would have paid for fees, the borrowers
can quickly become “lenders to themselves.”
</blockquote>

The book goes a bit too far to portray everything as a
scarcity problem in my opinion. These problems influence
everyone at some point, but character also plays a role in how
strong this effect will be. Nevertheless, I recommend it to
everyone interested in human behavior, especially to designers
and managers. Being reminded once again that people make bad
decisions, not only because of their flawed characters, but
also because of circumstance, is a powerful tool in building
humane products and services.
