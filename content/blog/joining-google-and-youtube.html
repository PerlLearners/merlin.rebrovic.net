It's official now - I'll be joining YouTube team in Zurich.
It wasn't an easy decision because it requires significant
life changes, but it's very good from a professional
standpoint. Google has been voted [the best place to
work][google] once again, YouTube is currently the third [most
popular website][popular] in the world and there are a LOT of
smart people working there. The opportunity to learn and grow
is enormous.

How the hell did that happen?
-----------------------------

I expect this to be the most common question from private
and business circles in the following days and weeks.

When I announced I'm leaving Five Minutes internally, I
didn't have any specific plans. A general direction was to
continue with my own consultancy to work with existing
partners and clients, and maybe work on some personal projects
or products. I applied to a few current job openings with a
simple goal of gathering some experience and insights from the
industry and the field; to compare myself in the market if you
will.

One of those jobs was for Interaction Designer in Google. The
process was long and most of the action was in December, with
some waiting over the holidays. I almost forgot about it,
making plans more formal here in Zagreb. But two weeks ago
everything picked up, great results came back from Google and
they threw an offer my way a few days ago. After weighing all
options and talking with friends and family, a decision
was made.


But why?
--------

I get two responses when I tell people about it - either they
get excited or sad. Sometimes both. Reasons for sadness are:
we won't be able to see each other anymore, I'll be missed
from the local professional community, Croatia can never get
better if good people leave, etc.

I understand that, I really do. It's inevitable that some
things built over the decades will decline or get lost
forever. Although painful to watch, it will create an
opportunity for new experiences: learning and personal growth,
new business challenges, traveling and exploring the world,
testing old and fostering new friendships, creating a family
in a more healthier environment.

I don't know where this could take me. I'm sure it won't be
perfect. But I know I would regret it if I don't try.
