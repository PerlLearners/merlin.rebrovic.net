    Neuschwanstein is one of the most iconic castles in the

Neuschwanstein is one of the most iconic castles in the world.
But when I came closer and saw how many things are not
finished, and that a thriving fast-track business had been
build around it with thousands of tourists visiting every day,
the castle lost some of its charm.

It, as many other things in life, is better observed from far
away where its external beauty shines. It is, after all, the
most beautiful fairy tale castle.
