I find that I'm happiest with my work when I'm able to remove
most of it. Not that I think it's bad, but it might not be
needed in the end. Creative processes often create a bit of an
overhead because it takes time and a few tries to finalize an
idea. Everything that was gathered on the way and is not
essential should be removed. It doesn't matter if it's pixels,
words or lines of code. If you have less of it, the final
product will be simpler, easier to use, more understandable
and less prone to errors and mistakes.
