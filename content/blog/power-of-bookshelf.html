People who know me well know I like to read a lot. Most books
I've read in the last few years were in some kind of digital
format. Paper books are not as convenient in situations I
usually find myself.

There is one issue I have with digital books which changed a
lot of things for me - they're invisible. What I mean is when
you visit someone you can quickly glance at the bookshelf and
see what's there. Sometimes it's a great conversation starter,
sometimes a great profiler. A small handmade rack with comic
and fantasy books coupled with programming manuals will paint
a different picture than a long line of medical journals and
modern European history on an expensive shelf.  Mint condition
dusty books show no use at all, but slightly worn out copies
with sticky notes can be a sign of an engaged mind. It's the
same for companies or institutions, and their libraries.

Web and social media have lowered privacy barriers, but the
information found online is often faked and filtered. And you
probably won't get access to someone's Kindle account. People
rarely buy books to show off and impress others, mostly it's
for their private interests, education and entertainment.
Although I fully support the idea of digital books, I will
still miss the glimpse into someone's mind in the form of a
plain old bookshelf.
