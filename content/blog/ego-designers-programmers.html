title: Ego - designers and programmers

I've been asked after my presentation on Webcamp Zagreb do I think
designers or programmers have bigger egos. As my answer was picked up on
Twitter more than a few times, I decided to put it here.

I believe that programmers have bigger egos. Not because designers don't
have the capacity to think of themselves as superheroes :), it's just
that their work is viewed, and therefore criticized, by more people. The
fact that a visual work is much easier to comprehend in much less time
only increases the likelihood of a feedback.

Code is often hard to read by other programmers, especially if using
different technologies. It's totally impossible to read and evaluate by
non-programmers. Only few people, if any, ever see what someone wrote,
so it's very easy to fool yourself in thinking how good you are.

Times are changing, though. GitHub, Bitbucket and similar services have
opened the code for others to see and comment. Companies that practice
quality code reviews also help programmers gain a different perspective
of their skills. But even then, every developer still thinks he's the
best, right? ;)
