{% mark excerpt %}
I was pretty quiet during June; minimal presence on social
networks and no new articles. The main reason is I had some
personal and group projects going on. Most of them are for
helping others and giving back to the community.

## Cipele46

At the beginning of this year, [Ana] and I came to an idea to
build a service that could help those less fortunate by
donating things people don't use anymore. Over the next few
months the idea and the team grew and found a partner in the
Cipele46 initiative. You can read [their story] and also look
at what the fabulous group of forty people built this
Saturday in a full day [hackathon].

## Hyde Starter Kit

This is my first open-source project, started in 2011. [Hyde],
a static website generator used to build this site, is a great
program, but it lacks documentation. People new to Hyde don't
know where to start, so I created a template that acts as a
tutorial. There were some major updates to Hyde recently, so
the template had to be updated too. The code is available at
[GitHub][hsk].

## Focus.vim

This is a Vim plugin. If you work with a lot of windows or on
a widescreen monitor, check out [how it works][focus]. It
started as a prototype, but finished as a nice piece of
working code, available at [GitHub][].
