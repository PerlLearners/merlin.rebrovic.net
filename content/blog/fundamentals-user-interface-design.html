## History

I first gave this presentation in 2012 to a group of computer
science students at the [University of Zagreb][1]. It was an
introduction to a workshop during which they had to create
interface concepts for their projects. The idea of teaching
programmers basic visual design skills proved successful, so I
was invited again next year.

Between those two lectures I also gave this presentation to
more experienced programmers in my previous company Five
minutes, now called just [Five][2]. The result was also
positive: increased vocabulary and shared understanding
improved designer-programmer collaboration on all future
projects.

Now, after a long break, I revisited the presentation,
improved it, and shared it publicly. At the same time I
presented it to a group of software engineers in Google,
continuing this successful educational series.
