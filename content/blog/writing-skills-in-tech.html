Writing well opens doors in your professional life. Writing
badly is shooting yourself in the foot. By _writing_ I mean
written communication, not writing a novel or another work of
fiction. I still firmly believe that communication is a
critical component for success in business and written
communication plays a major role in that.

We write a lot these days: emails, proposals, design briefs,
pitches, project requirements, presentations, user interface
or marketing copy, performance reviews, specifications, legal
documents. The list is endless. Clients and colleagues don't
sit next to us as often as before. Distant offices and time
zones make real-time communication impossible. More and more
context has to be written down as companies grow. To make
things harder, we often write in foreign languages. 

I've been thinking a lot about all of this lately. If writing
skills are so needed and useful, why aren't they taught more?
Many professional authors say how important writing is for
improving critical thinking, expression, and clarity. I expect
that argument from people who write books for a living, but
it's a pleasant surprise when it comes from programmers.

Michael "Rands" Lopp, a software engineering manager, thinks
you should learn to write to have a broader impact.

<blockquote>
<p>I believe there are essential skills you learn as an
engineer who codes. [...] However, there is a language you
could master that teaches many of the same lessons, appears
far more forgiving in terms of syntax, and has immediate
broader appeal. The language you can learn is your own. I
argue that there is an essential set of skills that intersect
both with writing words and writing code.</p>

<p>Writing is the connective tissue that creates
understanding. We, as social creatures, often better perform
rituals to form understanding one on one, but good writing
enables us to understand each other at scale.</p>

Grammar and clarity are important in writing, but in a
different way. Imagine a fancy dinner party. Grammar is like
wearing formal clothes--it will get you in and give you an
opportunity. Clarity is how you behave--the skill that leaves
a lasting impression.

<blockquote>
<p>If your writing is semi-literate, ungrammatical, and
riddled with misspellings, many hackers (including myself)
will tend to ignore you. While sloppy writing does not
invariably mean sloppy thinking, we've generally found the
correlation to be strongâ€”and we have no use for sloppy
thinkers. If you can't yet write competently, learn to.</p>

Paul Graham writes about differences between speaking and
writing in terms of idea generation and presentation.

<blockquote>
<p>Having good ideas is most of writing well. If you know what
you're talking about, you can say it in the plainest words and
you'll be perceived as having a good style. With speaking it's
the opposite: having good ideas is an alarmingly small
component of being a good speaker. [...] Occasionally the
stimulation of talking to a live audience makes you think of
new things, but in general this is not going to generate ideas
as well as writing does, where you can spend as long on each
sentence as you want.</p>

        Speaking</a>, Paul Graham</cite>

Nowhere is the need to write well so obvious as in design of
digital applications and services. The old world of paper
forms, knobs, and physical buttons is dwarfed by a screen that
serves as a portal to a completely new universe. Digital
interfaces are fluid and complex, requiring clear instructions
to navigate. The line between delighting people and making
them frustrated is thin.

I've been working as a designer for years now. I can [come up
with a narrative][1] and write solid user interface copy.
Despite that, I'm humbled every time I work with professional
copywriters or user researchers. They take my words, throw out
half of them, rearrange the rest, and make everything twice as
clear. It's always so obvious when I read the results that I
wonder why I didn't write it like that in the first place. The
answer is simple--it's years of practice and experience. Or
maybe just pure magic.

If you want to brush up your skills, I can recommend two
resources:

* A short article on [principles for great interface
  copywriting][2] by Google Ventures.
* The old and proven [The Elements of Style][3] if you need to
  write something longer. It's available for free on Project
  Gutenberg and most relevant for writing in English.

As with any other skill, writing can only improve through
practice. When I read my early blog posts, I immediately want
hide in the closet. Embarrassing as it is, it also shows
progress; I wouldn't notice otherwise. It's like reading your
old code and wondering what incompetent person wrote this. I
hope the same will happen with this post in a year or two.

It's hard to escape writing. And why should we? Let's embrace
it instead. Start writing and [edit often][4].
