I discovered this phrase years ago as one of Toyota Production
System's core principles. Genchi genbutsu roughly translates
to "go and see for yourself". It means you have to come to the
place where actual work is done and observe. This is the only
way to understand a problem and come up with a solution.

The Japanese words sounds mysterious and wise, but there are
Western counterparts to this idea too. For example, serial
entrepreneur [Steve Blank][1] has been saying for a long time
that the key to startup success is "getting out of the
building". Lean startup movement follows Steve's Customer
development method. It revolves around the same idea of
validating assumptions early on. [Management by wandering
around][2] is an even older method that produces equal results.

Designers and entrepreneurs assume a lot about the world and
people in it. The assumptions are often incorrect and lead to
failure. Although I have known this for a long time, its
importance has sunk in only recently. It was, of course,
through personal experience.

I designed many complex projects outside of my area of
expertise and testing them with target audience was a
necessary part of the process. The biggest problem are simpler
projects whose solutions are often marked as _obvious_.
_Obvious_ is a dangerous word. _Obvious_ means other people
have the same experience, thoughts, and assumptions as I do.
Nothing could be further from the truth.

Luckily, with growing experience I can now recognize those
_obvious_ solutions early on. Then I "go out and see for
myself". I'm surprised how much I learn every time.
