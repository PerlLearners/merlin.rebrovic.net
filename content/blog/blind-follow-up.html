About two months ago I did a "[blind for a day]([[
blog/blind-for-a-day.html ]])" experiment and
the feedback I got afterwards was overwhelmingly positive. A
quick online search shows that I wasn't the first person to do
it, which was expected, but it also points to the other side
of the experience--negative reactions to the experiment from
the visually impaired or reasons why sighted people should not
do it. It boils down to comments like this:

> I really find these whatever for a day experiments really
> patronizing and irritating. People tend to walk away with a
> smug satisfaction that they know how it is to be blind/deaf/in
> a chair, but they can take off the blindfold whenever.
{% endmark %}

And then bro fisting:

> Yeah, these blindfolds/glasses are only good for a short
> time. They don't let you experience visual impairment like
> we all have different versions of. I can imagine that smug
> look and it pisses me off!

Whoa! Really?

I can understand some people are frustrated by their current
condition and that some sighted experimenters behave like
they've accomplished world peace, but comments like these are
not helping anyone. Why not try with _"Hey, there's more to it
than it seems. Would you like to learn about it?"_

Luckily, there are positive stories where both sighted and
unsighted people work together to build empathy. For example,
there are "[Dialogue in the Dark][1]" exhibitions where ...

> ... visitors are led by blind guides through a specially
> constructed and completely darkened space. Conveying the
> characteristics of a familiar environment such as a park, a
> street or a bar, a daily routine turns into a new experience.
> ... Conducted by blind coaches and facilitators, participants
> are guided through a set of experiential learning activities
> and experience a reinforcement of their collaborative
> mind-set and emotional intelligence.

The second positive example I found was [an article by a young
blind programmer][2]. In an effort to introduce his world to
others he describes how he codes, what tools he uses and what
problems he faces. There is even a recording of a screen
reader going through some source code; it's completely
incomprehensible to me, but fascinating how someone's brain
can pick that up.

To close with something inspiring, have a look at the first
reaction of a blind patient fitted with bionic eyes.
Technology really does wonders when used in a right way. And
who knows, in a couple of decades this article may be an
interesting historic record in a new world without blindness.
