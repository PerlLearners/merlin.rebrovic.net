From [Love what you do][1], as a call to welcome less
interesting parts of your pursuit:

> Try to embrace all aspects of your current job and do it the
> best you can. Fall in love with it, not because it's a good
> mantra, but because it'll make your work outstanding.

In the two and a half years since that post, I have found
some more examples of the same idea.

The first one is from Flow, a book by a psychologist Mihály
Csíkszentmihályi where he summarizes his research of _optimal
experience_:

> Another one of our respondents, a worker named Rico
> Medellin, gets this feeling quite often on his job. He works
> in the same factory as Julio, a little further up on the
> assembly line. The task he has to perform on each unit that
> passes in front of his station should take forty-three
> seconds to perform--the same exact operation almost six
> hundred times in a working day.
> 
> Most people would grow tired of such work very soon. But
> Rico has been at this job for over five years, and he still
> enjoys it. The reason is that he approaches his task in the
> same way an Olympic athlete approaches his event: How can I
> beat my record? Like the runner who trains for years to
> shave a few seconds off his best performance on the track,
> Rico has trained himself to better his time on the assembly
> line. With the painstaking care of a surgeon, he has worked
> out a private routine for how use his tools, how to do his
> moves. After five years, his best average for a day has been
> twenty-eight seconds per unit.
> 
> In part he tries to improve his performance to earn a bonus
> and the respect of his supervisors. But most often he does
> not even let on to others that he is ahead and lets his
> success pass unnoticed. It is enough to know that he can do
> it, because when he is working at top performance the
> experience is so enthralling that it is almost painful for
> him to slow down.

From [Payoff][2], a book by a researcher in behavioral
economics Dan Ariely:

> From time to time, we find ourselves bored and unmotivated
> at work or at home. Like Sisyphus, we end up doing the same
> humdrum, unrewarding thing over and over. What can we do to
> change the situation when it is impossible to change the
> circumstances? The answer: change your mental framing.
> 
> For example, a young man I know recently took a job at a
> hospital, disposing of waste and cleaning surgical
> equipment. After a few months on the job, he found it so
> boring that he considered quitting. But his mother reminded
> him that he had one of the most important jobs in the
> hospital because people in hospitals are especially
> vulnerable to killer germs like staph. Without his important
> work, she explained, these patients could easily become
> sicker and die. This shift in perspective renewed his pride
> in his job. He performed it with more energy, and not too
> long afterward he received a promotion.
 
From a [Huffington Post interview][3] with Andrew Ng, a
co-founder of Coursera and a machine learning researcher:

> Q: Is there anything about your education or your early
> career that you would have done differently? Any lessons
> you've learned that people could benefit from?
> 
> A: I wish we as a society gave better career advice to young
> adults. I think that "follow your passion" is not good
> career advice. It's actually one of the most terrible pieces
> of career advice we give people.
> 
> If you are passionate about driving your car, it doesn't
> necessarily mean you should aspire to be a race car driver.
> In real life, "follow your passion" actually gets amended
> to, "Follow your passion of all the things that happen to be
> a major at the university you're attending."
> 
> But often, you first become good at something, and then you
> become passionate about it. And I think most people can
> become good at almost anything.

This is a blog post template. It forms a basic structure and
contains all elements that can go into a blog post. My
thinking was that it's much quicker to remove what's not
needed than to search and remember where I used something.
