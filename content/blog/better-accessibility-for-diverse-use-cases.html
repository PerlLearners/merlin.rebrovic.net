I've become a parent recently and the way I use technology
changed in a way I didn't expect. I do way more things with
one hand than before. A newborn baby requires a lot of
attention and there are always some chores to do. For the most
part, I didn't use a tablet at all, mostly my phone. I use
swiping instead of typing with two hands (thumbs); that's how
I wrote this post. I read and try to tap on things while on
the move, so there is a lot of shaking and imprecision. I
often lay down my phone and read from a distance because I
need space and both hands to do something.

You can probably assume I'm writing this because the text is
too small and the user interface doesn't scale well with
increasing its default size. There are also a lot of misplaced
taps and sometimes it's hard to undo a slip I make. Some
actions like zoom-in/out are almost impossible to do with one
hand, but they shouldn't be. And don't get me started on
oversized phones.

The described behavior might as well come from a person with a
disability or an impairment. That's why accessibility is
important, not only for people with medical problems, but also
for those who find themselves in new and diverse situations
where they can't use technology in an optimal way.
