    An alternative way to create a storyboard.
---

I've recently ran a design sprint and I had this "great" idea
of writing and publishing a short post after each day to
summarize tips and tricks, but logistics and facilitation took
all my time away. Nevertheless, I found one interesting
storyboarding technique that I'd like to share.

Storyboards are visual narratives and I've seen many
approaches to creating one: whiteboard or paper sketches,
digital comic builders, or photos of people in a slideshow.
The new approach that really delighted me was building one
with LEGO. It requires more upfront work than sketching, but
the result is clean and feels more real, so it looks like a
good choice for a storyboard that needs to live for a longer
period of time.

LEGO even provides an app for recording and editing movies if
you want to go beyond photos. _Note: the app is only
available for iOS at the time of writing._
