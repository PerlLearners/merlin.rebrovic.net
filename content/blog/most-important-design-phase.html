I had an interesting discussion a few days ago about my
personal UX design process. Without going into details, here
is a rough and oversimplified list:

1. Research
2. Creation (wireframes and prototypes)
3. Testing
4. Reviewing implementation

Research and Testing can be bundled together under "Finding a
solution". What are people's goals and problems? How can the
project or product to be designed help them? Do I, as a
designer, have wrong assumptions that are leading me astray?
How can I test those assumptions? These phases are primarily
concerned with finding and iterating on a solution.

Creation and Review can be grouped in "Team communication". A
solution should be obvious from good and quality research.
Creating wireframes is just a visualization that helps to
communicate an idea to developers and stakeholders*. It can
also be a nice starting point for testing.

Most deliverables visible to non-designers come out from "Team
communication" phases in the form of wireframes, prototypes
and later working code. This is the main reason why most
people are too focused on these deliverables and think
Creation phase is the most important.

Good design is not wireframes; [sometimes they aren't even
needed][1]. If you want to build meaningful things, don't miss
the real design work that happens during research and testing.
