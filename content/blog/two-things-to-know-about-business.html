The quote from <cite>Hackers and Painters</cite> by Paul
Graham sounds deceivingly simple, but it rings true.

<blockquote cite="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">
There are only two things you have to know about business:
build something users love, and make more than you spend. If
you get these two right, you'll be ahead of most startups. You
can figure out the rest as you go.
</blockquote>
