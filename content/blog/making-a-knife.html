    A short photo story of how I forged my first knife.

{% mark excerpt %}
"Congratulations!" he said while we jointly submerged a
glowing piece of metal in an oil bath. I just quenched my
first knife after heat treating and the process felt like
having another baby.

It started four hours earlier when our group gathered in a
bladesmith's workshop. He started with safety rules and
equipment, and followed with a rough plan. Yes, we will start
with a small steel bar and go home with a finished knife. Yes,
we will heat it until it glows and pound it with a hammer. It
will be the real thing.

Blazing furnaces burn skin through gloves. Anvils sound like
church bells. Grinding stones, aggressive and sharp like
piranha's teeth, are waiting for my slip. It's magical.

Two opportunities attracted me to this endeavour: to create
one of the first human tools and to go beyond designing
digital interfaces. Crafting a physical item invokes a special
feeling that is lost when creating something that will be
forever trapped in pixels behind a glass.

Everyone in the group started with the same piece of metal,
used the same tools, and followed the same process, but every
knife looked different. Each of us had their own vision and
work style, which was reflected in the final shape, and with
it, utility.

I talked with the bladesmith during a break and two of his
remarks resonated with me.

* He has been forging blades for 19 years, but he still tries
  to learn and improve with every new blade he makes. There is
  always something new he can try or make more complex to
  challenge himself.
* As a craftsman, he takes immense pride in high quality and
  effectiveness of his creations. Although he appreciates
  beauty very much, it comes second; function comes first.
