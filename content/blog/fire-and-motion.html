    A quote by Joel Spolsky on importance of moving forward
    every day.
---

By [Joel Spolsky][1] from the turn of the 21st century, but
still relevant.

> When I was an Israeli paratrooper a general stopped by to
> give us a little speech about strategy. In infantry battles,
> he told us, there is only one strategy: Fire and Motion. You
> move towards the enemy while firing your weapon. The firing
> forces him to keep his head down so he can't fire at you.
> (That's what the soldiers mean when they shout "cover me."
> It means, "fire at our enemy so he has to duck and can't
> fire at me while I run across this street, here." It works.)
> The motion allows you to conquer territory and get closer to
> your enemy, where your shots are much more likely to hit
> their target. If you're not moving, the enemy gets to decide
> what happens, which is not a good thing. If you're not
> firing, the enemy will fire at you, pinning you down.
>
> I remembered this for a long time. I noticed how almost
> every kind of military strategy, from air force dogfights to
> large scale naval maneuvers, is based on the idea of Fire
> and Motion. It took me another fifteen years to realize that
> the principle of Fire and Motion is how you get things done
> in life. You have to move forward a little bit, every day.
> It doesn't matter if your code is lame and buggy and nobody
> wants it. If you are moving forward, writing code and fixing
> bugs constantly, time is on your side. Watch out when your
> competition fires at you. Do they just want to force you to
> keep busy reacting to their volleys, so you can't move
> forward?

You have to move forward a little bit, every day.
