The face in front of me is familiar. It shows a hint of
surprise and disbelief, with a swarm of questions behind it.
Only one gets out: "Why?"

That's the reaction I get when engineers find out I switched
from software development to design. The question often comes
up when I meet new people professionally and this was also the
case after joining Google. I shared my reasoning so many times
I finally decided to write it down.
{% endmark %}

Working as a software engineer on customer facing or
business-to-business products means you'll usually get the
specification (documents, mocks, prototypes) and implement it.
Almost everything has been defined by the time you start and
it's very hard to change it. This is a critical point and I
want you to emphasise the consequence--the vast greatness of
your engineering skills won't matter at all if you're solving
a wrong problem or solving the right problem in a wrong way
(eg. with a terrible user interface). [Beautiful code and
architecture][1] wasted on something like that is a depressing
thought, at least for me.

Finding a team with a proven process where everyone gets the
opportunity to share their own expertise on multiple occasions
while outlining the solution is rare. The waterfall
method--with specific phases well defined and siloed--is still
very common.

My idea was that by moving up the pipeline I would be able to
influence the problem solving part a bit more. The pipeline
usually starts with product/project managers and designers
following closely. I've tried both roles, but leaned more
toward design because there more hands-on work gets done. The
good news is that this idea has been validated--since I
switched, I have been able to outline right solutions
completely or at least steer it in the right direction.

Two questions usually follow: one asked out loud, the other
left hanging in the air.

"Do you miss coding?" is the loud one. Yes, I do. But I'm also
very satisfied with what I'm doing at the moment and that
takes away some of the pain. I also work on my website, build
prototypes for testing and help with front-end stuff so it's
not like I don't know how to exit Vim anymore.

"Are engineers just implementors who can't contribute to
problem solving?" Absolutely not. It's sad some people have
that sentiment. Engineers garner a lot of technical knowledge
and expertise. They bring a different perspective and
innovative ideas to the table; that's why I always try to
bring them in early during the process.

So that's it folks, the reasoning behind the switch, for
better or worse. My working experience is split evenly between
design and engineering up to this point in time. I'm looking
forward to see what happens in the future--will one prevail or
will a third option take over.
