    Microsoft's inclusive design principles help foster empathy.
---

Microsoft's [inclusive design principles][1] struck a chord
with me. I especially like their Persona Spectrum:

> We use the Persona Spectrum to understand related mismatches
> and motivations across a spectrum of permanent, temporary,
> and situational scenarios. It's a quick tool to help foster
> empathy and to show how a solution scales to a broader
> audience.

I was in a [similar situation last year][2]:

> I became a parent last month and the way I use technology
> has changed in a way I didn't expect. I do way more things
> with one hand than before. A newborn baby requires a lot of
> attention and there are always some chores to do. 

I encourage you to visit [Microsoft Design website][1] and
check out their manual and activity cards--great resources to
foster empathy.
