This demo and blog post almost didn't see the light of day.
The Web has produced [impressive][1] [3D apps][2]
[recently][3] and my concept seemed unremarkable compared to
them. But after thinking about it for some time I realized I
had built a _Hello World_ example and it's not fair to compare
it to other apps. And my _Hello World_ packs some interesting
features too.

I recommend opening the link on a phone or a tablet. I tested
it in Chrome and Safari, so it should work on all newer
Android and iOS devices. It will also work on desktop
browsers, but you'll have to start the animation manually.

If it got you interested, read on about my motivation and the
technology used to build it.

Motivation
----------

[WebGL support][4] is improving daily and our mobile devices
are more powerful than our desktop computers from a couple of
years ago. All of this rekindled my passion for computer
graphics. At the university I took all available computer
graphics and virtual reality classes. There weren't as many
as I wanted, but I had the opportunity to play with OpenGL and
C among other things.

Times have changed and JavaScript is all the rage nowadays.
WebGL, a subset of OpenGL for the Web, is supported by many
browsers today, so I wanted to give it a try. The problem is I
completely forgot how OpenGL works.

I had found a [WebGL course on Coursera][5] and decided I'll
use it as a paced refresher. During the whole summer I was
watching lectures and doing homework in my off-work hours. It
was like being in school again--working and studying at the
same time.

I passed the course mid-September last year. I built some
interesting things for assignments, but couldn't share them
due to Coursera's restrictions; future course students might
use them as their own submissions. At the same time, I wanted
to build something for mobile. At concat in March 2015,
[Franzisca Hinkelmann][6] demonstrated new and interesting web
<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s.
One of them was _device orientation_ and it just stuck in my
mind.

It is not a surprise my first idea was to build something in
WebGL that would react to rotation of a mobile device. I coded
the concept in early fall, but had to leave it unfinished due
to travel and work. Winter holidays came to the rescue. One
long weekend later and the cube was ready.

WebGL
-----

[WebGL][7] is the star of the show. It's a flavor of OpenGL,
_"first created as an open and reproducable alternative to
Iris GL which had been the proprietary graphics API on Silicon
Graphics workstations"_ ([source][8]). In short: old. It's
close to hardware and operates with global states, and that
makes it hard to wrap your head around because it's so
different from modern application development.

On top of that, WebGL requires two languages to function:
JavaScript and [GLSL][9]. The first is for initialization and
application logic (events, interface manipulation, etc). The
second resembles C and is used to write _shaders_.

_Vertex and fragment shaders_ are GLSL programs which modify
positions of vertices and colors of surfaces respectively.
They run on <abbr title="Graphical Processing Unit">GPU</abbr>
and can process huge amounts of data. Imagine a 3D scene with
millions of vertices. If the camera rotates, all vertices have
to change their position. This would be slow in JavaScript on
a single thread in a browser, but is running blazing fast on a
dedicated hardware. _Shaders_ are linked from HTML the same
way as JavaScript and CSS.

I didn't use any libraries to build the WebGL cube. I borrowed
some helper functions from the author of the course to help
with WebGL initialization and managing transformation of
vectors and matrices between JavaScript and GLSL. Working
bare-bones was a great learning experience, but also hard.
Unless I'll want to build my own WebGL engine, I'll use
[three.js][10], [GooEngine][11], or some other library in the
future because they provide a reasonable level of abstraction.

One resource I highly recommend is [WebGL Fundamentals][12].
It's a series of almost thirty in-depth articles with clear
explanations, code examples, and visualizations.

Device orientation
------------------

Detecting device orientation is critical for this concept and
fortunately not complex. An event listener is added to
_deviceorientation_ if supported and the event returns 
three angles which define the physical device in space.

The biggest problem is inconsistency; different browser makers
return different ranges for angles, so the cube might rotate
in different directions if viewed in two different browsers.

[MDN docs][13] should be more than enough to start with device
orientation.

One tip to keep in mind: even desktop browsers support this,
so it's a not good indicator that someone is browsing on a
mobile device.

Screen orientation
------------------

The last thing I needed was to detect the screen orientation
change. I needed that for two reasons:

1. If I rotate a device to the side, my "up" and device's "up"
   don't match anymore, so I need to read different angles. To
   make things worse, I can rotate the device to left or right.
2. I wanted to make the cube always fully visible on the
   screen so I needed to resize the drawing canvas.

I first looked into [Screen Orientation API][14]. It is not as
supported as Device Orientation and different browsers return
different values depending on what they think "the right
orientation for that device" should be. While searching for an
easy solution I stumbled upon an interesting article that
describes [six CSS and JavaScript techniques to detect screen
orientation][15].

In the end I settled on something quick and dirty--I'm
listening to _resize_ event and checking if the viewport ratio
changed. It's not flawless and will break in some cases, but
does two things at the same time:

1. Handles resizing of desktop browsers.
2. Mobile browsers, for now, change their viewport ratios only
   when rotated. We'll see how it'll work out with split pane
   functionality some tablets will support in the future.

And that's all there is to it. Now go and [create something][16].
