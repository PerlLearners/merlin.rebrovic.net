I was attending [UX London](london) conference from 10th to
12th of April. It was a wonderful experience listening to
inspiring talks and attending intensive workshops. Three
points I took home from the conference are:

1. "We don't know what will work"
2. The advance of technology is way faster than we think
3. There are no UX gods

If you're interested in more details, you can read about the
conference and these points in [the full article][post].
