"My work matters," you think to yourself. In a small studio,
shop, or a startup, everything you do is significant. You can
see your contributions pushing the business forward every day.
You feel good about yourself.

If you're 1 of 3 people in a company, you're almost a
superhero. If you're 1 of 30, you might still feel you're
contributing. But if you're 1 of 3000, can you recognize your
impact on the whole business every day? If you leave for three
months, you'll find the company somehow survived without you.
Shocking, right?
{% endmark %}

This realization can be demotivating so you might start saying
to yourself, "Well, my contributions don't matter much, so
I'll skimp on quality and quantity. Work of other people will
hide my lack of enthusiasm for the job." You've landed on a
slippery slope, and you bet it's downhill from here on. The
problem is that other people, those that you hoped to rely on,
might think the same thing. Suddenly, instead of making a lot
of right decisions, thousands of people are making a lot of
bad decisions--a sure path to a catastrophe.

Both your boss and you need to figure out how your work fits
into a bigger picture. He or she needs to provide context and
set a goal. It's up to you to look around, see what other
teams are doing, and watch where your industry is heading. You
shouldn't make your job your meaning of life--unless you want
to--but you should know how your work contributes to the
whole. Even if you have a job you don't like and have to do to
make ends meet, [changing your perspective and finding out why
that work is important][1] will make it easier for you and
better for the business.

Finding a purpose in your work is critical. You might be a cog
in a machine, but you should be a cog that is enabling the
machine to function properly.
