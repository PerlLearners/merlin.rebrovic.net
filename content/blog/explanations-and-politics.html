    Just as science seeks explanations that are experimentally

    or policy is bad, and to remove them without violence if

{% mark excerpt %}
I'm reading [Beginning of Infinity](http://beginningofinfinity.com/),
an excellent book by a physicist David Deutsch. It explores
diverse topics like critical thinking, scientific method,
quantum theory, societies, and philosophy. It looks like it's
all over the place, but it tries, and succeeds, in showing the
necessity and importance of good explanations throughout all
topics.

And then there's a chapter about choice and politics.
Politics and I mix like water and oil, but I was so intrigued
by what I read and how it relates to what is currently
happening in my home country that I explored the topic
further.

The author writes: 

<blockquote>
Just as science seeks explanations that are experimentally
testable, so a rational political system makes it as easy as
possible to detect, and persuade others, that a leader or
policy is bad, and to remove them without violence if they
are. [...] Thus, systems of government are to be judged not
for their prophetic ability to choose and install good leaders
and policies, but for their ability to remove bad ones that
are already there.
</blockquote>

Remove bad ones that are already there. This is the keystone
of the whole piece. We, as a society, need to test new ideas
and if they're better, replace the old ones. But ...

<blockquote>
Why would anyone want to replace bad leaders and policies at
all? That question may seem absurd, but perhaps it is absurd
only from the perspective of a civilization that takes
progress for granted. If we did not expect progress, why
should we expect the new leader or policy, chosen by whatever
method, to be any better than the old? [...] Unless a society
is expecting its own future choices to be better than its
present ones, it will strive to make its present policies and
institutions as immutable as possible. Therefore [the
previous] criterion can be met only by societies that expect
their knowledge to grow.
</blockquote>

The way to improve and grow is to be able to **quickly** try
out new ideas.

Let me summarize the situation in Croatia a few months ago.
The two biggest parties, one on left and one on right that are
always competing and are in power for decades, came on top
in parliamentary elections with numbers of seats tied. This
meant a coalition with other parties was necessary to form a
government. After two months of public circus, the right wing
party formed a coalition with the party that got the third
biggest share of the seats. They were newcomers to this
election and behaved like they were running the show. And it
was a show, although a bad one.

Back to the book. The author elaborates on pros and cons of
some apportionment and electoral systems. He specifically
describes proportional representation, where a number of seats
is proportional to the number of votes.

<blockquote>
But that is really the least of the irrational attributes of
proportional representation [ed. the one used in Croatia]. A
more important one which is shared by even the mildest of
proportional systems is that they assign disproportionate
power in the legislature to the <strong>third-largest
party</strong>, and often to even smaller parties. It works
like this. It is rare (in any system) for a single party to
receive an overall majority of votes. Hence, if votes are
reflected proportionately in the legislature, no legislation
can be passed unless some of the parties cooperate to pass it,
and no government can be formed unless some of them form a
coalition. Sometimes the two largest parties manage to do
this, but the most common outcome is that the leader of the
third-largest party holds the 'balance of power' and decides
which of the two largest parties shall join it in government,
and which shall be for how long. That means that it is
sidelined, and correspondingly harder for the electorate to
decide which party, and which policies, will be removed from
power.
</blockquote>

This makes me sad. There is a weird system that struggles to
remove bad actors which in turn makes present policies and
institutions as immutable as possible. I used Croatia as an
example because it's recent and close to me, but the book also
lists other modern and affluent countries that encounter the
same problem.

An additional source of grievance is that there is already a
good explanation why this system doesn't work, but there seems
to be no will, at least from the majority, to change it. And
according to the author, this means that society as a whole
doesn't expect progress and better choices in the future.
