Let me tell you about my recent smartwatch experiment. Last
year I wrote a [post about how I couldn't think of any good
way to incorporate that technology in my life](http://merlin.rebrovic.net/blog/my-dumb-analog-watch).
It's always prudent to question your own beliefs and reasoning
from time to time, so I decided to borrow a smartwatch for two
weeks and use it as much as I could.

I returned it four days later. I tried, I really tried, but I
couldn't find any use for it in my daily routines. The only
exception was timekeeping and I already had a watch that could
do that without recharging every night. This doesn't mean
smartwatches are useless. Many people find them practical, but
not me.

I still think wearable technology will be a success in the
future. Sensors we'll constantly wear will help us with
personal tracking, interacting with devices, and health. But
maybe shoes count my steps better? Or a part of trousers
changes a song in a safer way during cycling instead fiddling
with a watch? Let's wait and see.
