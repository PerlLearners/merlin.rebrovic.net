Many people from tech bemoaned the launch of Facebook's
Instant Articles, and fortification of walled gardens and
native apps killing the web (again). Baldur Bjarnason
published [an excellent article][1] with aggregated
commentaries, but also added his owns words which hit the
bullseye.

> Here's an absolute fact that all of these reporters,
> columnists, and media pundits need to get into their heads:
>
> The web doesn't suck. Your websites suck.  
> All of your websites suck.
>
> You destroy basic usability by hijacking the scrollbar. You
> take native functionality (scrolling, selection, links,
> loading) that is fast and efficient and you rewrite it with
> 'cutting edge' javascript toolkits and frameworks so that it
> is slow and buggy and broken. You balloon your websites with
> megabytes of cruft. You ignore best practices. You take
> something that works and is complementary to your business
> and turn it into a liability.

The [whole article][1] is well worth reading, so please do it.
It might even serve as a pivot in the way people think about
web, for example like Ethan Marcotte's [article about
responsive web design][2] five years ago.
