Andrew Ng, a co-founder of Coursera and the chief scientist at
Baidu Research, recently gave a talk at [Deep Learning
School][1].  At one point in [his presentation (10:16:42)][2],
he described the current process of building desktop and
mobile apps in the industry: product managers and designers
iterate on ideas and interfaces before implementation.
However, with rising popularity of machine learning and its
complexity, it is difficult to grasp what is achievable with
those algorithms. Consequently, it is hard to write product
requirements or specification, so Andrew often receives the
question: "What can artificial intelligence or deep learning
do?"

He offers two rules of thumb that, while not perfect or
complete, are helpful in thinking what is possible with
machine learning.

1. Anything that a person can do in less than one second.
2. Predicting an outcome of a sequence of events.
