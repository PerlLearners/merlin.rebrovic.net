Education
---------

Solving a problem includes collaborating with engineering,
customer support, sales, marketing, operations, and other
roles. The process sometimes leads to conflicts because people
hold diverse opinions on what the priorities should be.
Designers, supposedly the endless pools of empathy, should be
the first to step back, and ask why is this happening.

Many people in other roles don't know about design thinking,
user-centered design, psychology, and similar areas. However,
designers can teach basic knowledge through conversations and
various activities (for example, asking to observe a usability
test or take part in exploratory research). Educating takes
time, but it is a necessary step toward a healthy long-term
collaboration.

Facilitation
------------

Designers usually find solutions for clients or stakeholders,
and their users. It is rare that designers fully understand
the area in which the problem resides. Just look at medicine,
law, music, commerce, or civil engineering; it could take
years, or even decades, to grasp the complexity of each
discipline. The only way to come to a solution in a short time
is to guide experts through a design process.

Facilitation is challenging because people provide a lot of
information and not everything is important, so designers have
to weed out the bits that are irrelevant to their task.
Moreover, experts in a field often know what they want but not
what they need. Wants and needs sometimes overlap, but when
they don't, designers should steer conversations in a way that
brings their clients to recognize their needs. This technique
is more useful than saying, "You're wrong; this is what we
need to do."

Representation
--------------

Although everyone starts with the goal to find the best
solution for a customer, life gets in the way. Leaders
compromise when deadlines loom and resources tighten. Every
person feels comfortable when working in his or her area of
expertise: engineers care about elegant solutions, code
quality, and technical details; product managers worry about
upcoming features, the business landscape, and competition.
However, who represents the people using the product?
Designers do.

Representing end users in this situation is not defending your
position stubbornly--even if it sometimes helps--but talking
about business benefits with a user-centered approach. This
means designers should understand the goals of different
corporate roles and be comfortable with business and technical
vocabularies. Although "creative types" usually dislike to
communicate in this style, it is necessary to know how to do
so.

Conclusion
----------

The three activities run in parallel and are inseparable.
Communication and humility are their fuel. Skip one activity,
and you will underdeliver; do all of them, and you will be on
your way to success.
