I finished "Man's Search For Meaning" by an Austrian
psychologist Viktor Frankl. He survived through several Nazi
concentration camps during World War II and in his book he
describes--from a doctors point of view--how people behaved
and coped. It is hard and depressing, but insightful read. Two
things stood out: humor and meaningfulness.

## Humor

Concentration camps don't seem like places where people laugh,
but Viktor writes:

<blockquote>
It is well know that humor, more than anything else in the
human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to rise
above any situation, even if only for a few seconds.
</blockquote>

And ...

<blockquote>
The attempt to develop a sense of humor and to see things in a
humorous light is some kind of a trick learned while mastering
the art of living.
</blockquote>

This isn't a new idea to me. More than a decade ago I read
Laurence Gonzales' "Deep Survival" in which he analyzes
survival and rescue situations that had arisen from wilderness
accidents. Here is one quote about firefighters:

<blockquote>
The guys called the big beer cooler in the kitchen "the baby
coffin." They had dozens of names for different types of
corpses--"crispy critters," "stingers," "floaters," "dunkers,"
and "Headless Horsemen," just to name a few. ... [someone]
thought I was either terribly disrespectful or out of my
gourd. The fact is you have to deal with these things to the
best of your ability. If you don't work with it, it'll get
you. A dead body is not something you get used to.
</blockquote>

Then a bit later ...

<blockquote>
Some high-angle rescue workers call body bags "long-term bivvy
sacks." It sounds cruel, but survivors laugh and play, and
even in the most horrible situations--perhaps especially in
those situations--they continue to laugh and play. To deal
with reality you must first recognize it as such, and play
puts a person in touch with his environment, while laughter
makes the feeling of being threatened manageable.
</blockquote>

The funny thing is, while I was trying to find this passage
that stayed with me for so long, I found a paper note tucked
between two pages with a quote from an unknown war novel. It's
about a dark and seemingly inappropriate humor soldiers
indulge in during hard times. External observers often judge
them because of that, but soldiers explain it's just a way of
coping when faced with unsurmountable odds; they are fully
aware where they are and, unfortunately, they never forget. It
looks like I was preparing to write this for a very long time.

## Meaningfulness

Let's get back to Viktor and concentration camps. Humor is
very helpful--no, essential--but is not a long-term solution.
How were those prisoners able to survive when there was almost
no hope, no freedom? The answer is surprising.

<blockquote>
We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who
walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their
last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but
they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from
a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms--to choose
one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose
one's own way. It is this spiritual freedom--which cannot be
taken away--that makes life meaningful and purposeful.
</blockquote>

This is probably the most powerful quote from the book. But it
also leaves room for another question: what is the meaning of
life? Viktor was approached many times with this question at
his office after the war.

<blockquote>
I doubt whether a doctor can answer this question in general
terms. For the meaning of life differs from person to person,
from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters,
therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather
the specific meaning of a person's life at a give moment.
</blockquote>

Nietzsche summarized it well:

<blockquote>
He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How.
</blockquote>
