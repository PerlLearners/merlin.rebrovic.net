    "Why am I not fearful of people who buy a nice camera and
    suddenly fancy themselves photographers? Because this shit
    I'm talking about doesn't come in the box."

From Zack Arias's Photography Q&A:

His words resonated with me despite the strong tone. I have
seen people buy $1500 laptops to learn programming or top of
the line archery equipment after shooting only a few arrows.
You don't need fancy equipment to be good at something,
especially if you're just starting out. You can surpass any
advantage equipment provides by learning and practicing more.
When your skill reaches soaring levels and starts to plateau,
then the equipment could make a difference. Olympic athletes,
polar explorers, and world-class artisans and professionals
need it. Are you there yet?

To drive the point home even further, just look at this guy
paint using popsicles.

I am also aware of the emotional side of this dilemma.
Sometimes more expensive things look nicer or send a certain
message. It's the looks, right? I get that. Buy the fancy
stuff if you can and want to. I am just saying that you don't
have to.
