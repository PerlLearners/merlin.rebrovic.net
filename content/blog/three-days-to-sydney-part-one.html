I was about to make the longest journey until that point in my
life. 28 hours to Australia. I was a bit worried, but also
excited to push the limit. I was to fly out of Zagreb on
Sunday afternoon and be in Sydney on Tuesday early morning
local time.

On the D-Day goodbyes were exchanged and a few tears danced
around the cheeks of interested parties before entering the
security check. The security at Pleso, Zagreb's airport, got
stricter lately. You have to show a boarding pass, then do a
body and baggage scan, then go through a passport control
(sometimes showing a boarding pass, too) and when you finally
get to the gate, you have to show the boarding pass and the
passport again. Mostly unnecessary and inefficient, but I got
through. 

The bus drove us to a Dash 8 turboprop airplane. This may be a
good time to say I don't like propeller airplanes. Especially
if I'm sitting just next to a propeller. Which I was, of
course. After the shortest safety demonstration ever,
conducted by two middle aged stewards who looked like they
really wanted to stay home today, the airplane propelled
itself into the sunset. My journey began ...

## Hour 0

... and got interesting. Twenty five minutes into the flight,
the pilot turned the speaker: "Dear passengers, I'm afraid I
have some bad news for you."

"OK", I'm thinking quickly, "if they didn't pack sandwiches, I
can deal with it. If there are problems and delays in
Frankfurt, I have a three hour layover, so I'll certainly make
it in time. I'm ready for everything. Come on, give me your
best shot!"

Pilot: "There has been a technical malfunction and we have to
go back to Zagreb. I'm sorry for any inconveniences."

The little angry voice in my head: "What? Take me back? And
you're _sorry_?! No, no, I don't buy it, where are hidden
cameras? Wait, why are you turning? Stop! You were serious?
Damn."

The plane turned around, the crew prepared us for the landing
and switched all cabin lights off for safety precautions. Do
you know those fluorescent lights on the floor that guide you
to exits in the case of an emergency, but are never turned on?
Well, they were now. And they were glowing ominously.

The plane was shaking during descent, followed by a pretty
rough landing and finishing with a breaking so strong that
many people had to push against the seat in front. I wasn't
scared; I was annoyed because nobody was telling us anything.

## Hour 1

The bus took us to a gate where they finally explained that we
can wait for another flight in about two hours certainly
missing all our connecting flights and then try our options
from Frankfurt or cancel that flight, stay in Zagreb and
negotiate another one at some future time. An elderly couple
overheard me mentioning Sydney, so they rushed to my side,
pretty confused and scared. They were flying there too, so she
asked me what should we do. At that moment, I knew "team
Sydney" was being formed. Let's call the new members Leo and
Mary.

We decided to stay in Zagreb and see if the ticketing office
could help us. The lady there found us the same tickets for
tomorrow. It was the earliest flight to Sydney, so I concluded
it was a good call to stay home. Waiting in Frankfurt would be
too much.

Team Sydney parted ways and agreed to try again tomorrow. Like
we had any choice :)
