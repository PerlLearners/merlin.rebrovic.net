It had been a year and a half since my last public appearance
due to personal and professional turn of events. The WebCamp
team from Zagreb offered me an opportunity to hold a Git
workshop, the one I've been successfully doing and improving
for the last five years.

Only when I was discussing technical intricacies of Git with
twenty participants and seeing how they grasp the inner
workings in such a short time, did I remember how much I love
to teach.
