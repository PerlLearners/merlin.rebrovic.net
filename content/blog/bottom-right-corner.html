    A simple hack that helped me cut down on social networks
    and spend more time on learning and creating.

{% mark excerpt %}
Our environments influence us. People, objects, interactions,
they all leave a mark or make us do things in a certain way.
And although most of that is subconscious, we're not helpless
and passive bystanders. We can design those environments to
serve our needs better.

One environment I'm particularly interested in is my phone. I
use it a lot and I'm aware it influences my behavior on an
hourly basis. I wanted to cut down time I spend on social
networks because a phone makes spending too much time on them
effortless--the apps are always in my pocket, just one tap
away, and always signed in.
{% endmark %}

I also noticed one peculiar behavior that subconsciously
turned into a habit--I tend to tap the bottom right icon a
lot, almost every time I have a minute to spare. It's probably
because the bottom row is fixed, so it draws more attention,
and because that icon is the easiest to tap with my right
thumb. And that's where some of the social apps were.

I wanted to turn this habit to my benefit, so I "redesigned"
that area (a fancy to say I rearranged some icons). I
completely removed the social networks from my home screen. In
the bottom right corner I put apps that I would like to
use more. 

{{ macros.external_figure("2016-03-11_bottom_row_icons.jpg",
"For the bottom rightmost icon, I alternated between a Google Docs
shortcut for writing and AnkiDroid flashcards I use for
foreign vocabulary.") }}

Lo and behold, my behavior changed. I didn't track usage and
can't provide any hard data, but it's so noticeable that it
doesn't really matter. I spend less time on social networks
and use it to learn or create. Redesign successful.
