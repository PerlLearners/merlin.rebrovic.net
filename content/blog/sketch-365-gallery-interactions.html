Interactions are the most complex and most interesting part of
[Sketch 365]([[ blog/sketch-365.html ]]). Not only that objects
have to be sketched correctly, but a sketch as a whole must
have a story and it has to clearly communicate ideas to
observers. All interaction sketches were created at the
beginning of personal or business projects to get the people
talking and collaborating around the initial idea.
