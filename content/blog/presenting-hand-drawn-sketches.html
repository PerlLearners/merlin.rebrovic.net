I was asked recently how do I present hand drawn sketches to
clients or team members and make the sketches work. The
question challenges a problem of some people considering hand
drawing just fooling around and not having great value. I
believe there are two ways to make it work.
{% endmark %}

## 1. Start early and manage expectations

Let's say a project lasts four months. If you get back to the
stakeholders three weeks after a kick-off meeting and show
them only a few pieces of paper, I assure you they were
expecting more.

It's much better to say "I'll send you a few rough ideas in a
day or two (or after a research phase) just to see we're on
the same page". When the sketches come in early, expectations
don't have enough time to inflate. And you framed the
deliverables by saying they are rough and should be used as
guidelines or clarifications only.

## 2. Do it with them

A paper sketch is generally worthless by itself. Developing an
idea through sketching and testing different options is what
makes it valuable, but that is something that's only in your
head most of the time. Other people see boxes, lines and not
much else.

What I urge you to do is to sketch in front of, or better yet,
with others (whiteboard or paper). Especially for the first
time. As you discuss ideas, the sketch will grow organically,
and what's more important, a story will begin to emerge
around it. Next time they see a sketch from you, they'll be
more receptive and will expect the reasoning behind it. Which
you'll most certainly have ready: in writing, on a conference
call or in person.

This approach is especially good if you have to do an
extensive research at the beginning; you can present your
finding and then start sketching around it, pointing to the
best solution outlined by the research.

## Don't worry, it will work

I hope this makes you a bit more relaxed about presenting your
work. Sketching is great and you should do it more often,
while keeping in mind that you have to provide some context
and a story for the other side.
