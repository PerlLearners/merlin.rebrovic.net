{% mark excerpt %}
At the very start of 2013 I finally came to terms with
a constant lack of time to do everything I wanted. I decided
to surf the tsunami and not fight against it.

rest a bit. Didn't happen. The new resolution is - full speed
ahead! Let's see where we can take it.",

A lot of things happened in those 365 days; some were planned,
some not so much. Here are some of the highlights and my
thoughts on them.

Traveling
---------

I was fortunate enough to travel a lot this year. Most trips
were for business, but some were for educational and private
purposes. Cars, buses and trains are standard means of travel
over small distances, but you need airplanes to cover a lot of
ground in short time. I had flown only 3 times before. Year
2013 ... was different.

"So, what's the most interesting thing you've discovered while
traveling?" you ask. Well, it would have to be the fact that
people are same wherever you go. Yes, some are more tanned
than others because of the sun and some speak different
languages and have different cultural norms. But when you move
those superficial things away, what remains is eerily similar
to you - a human being confused most of the time and constantly
looking for love and happiness. They/we all get hungry, cold,
sad and sick, and turn to friends, family, work and hobbies to
get better. The best way to lessen the effects of racism and
xenophobia is to travel, observe and talk to locals. It's hard
to be mean to people who are like us.


Reading
-------

Many of you are scratching your heads and thinking "Reading as
a highlight of the year?". Others probably closed the tab
already. But it's a big deal for me. I can't remember a time
in my life when I was not reading a lot (or listening to
audiobooks). This year I purchased a tablet and read about a
half of all books on it. It had become so convenient that
paper books are starting to feel clunky and difficult to
handle. They are not going away anytime soon, but eventually
they'll become collectables only.

"Reading stats for 2013.") }}

The top three categories are closely correlating with my work
throughout the year - working with clients and end users as an
interaction designer and team leader.

In a new world of extremely short attention spans, catchy
headlines and too many notifications while reading online,
books give you an opportunity to immerse yourself in an
environment of concentrated knowledge without distractions.
What's not to like?


Interesting bits and pieces
---------------------------

Too many things happened for one blog post. Here is a short
list of some other highlights:

* My younger sister got married putting unnecessary pressure
  on me ;)
* Finished my [Sketch 365 project][sketch].
* Spoke on local and international conferences and gave a
  lecture on the university I had attended as a student.
* Lived more than a month in Norway (cumulatively).
* Wrote my first [Vim plugin][focus].
* [Dived Great Barrier Reef][reef].

Saving the best for last
------------------------

Everything I mentioned is fun (I know we could debate about
reading being fun, but this is my post, so ...). It becomes
even better when shared with others. We often overlook the
fact that we did it for or with someone when making lists like
this. Traveling is exciting if you have a travel buddy or are
visiting an old friend. Sharing something you've created with
a significant other makes both of you feel better. All the
projects "I" have done in 2013 were actually a team effort
with my friends and colleagues.

Remember, photos you'll care about the most are ones with
people in it.


What next?
----------

The new year has just started and there are some interesting
developments already. The biggest professional change was
leaving Five Minutes in December. Working there was a
rewarding experience that enabled a lot of things mentioned
here and gave me an opportunity to meet some great people,
clients and colleagues alike.

I'm taking some time off to spend it with family and friends,
and to work on personal development. Let's see if we can
make 2014 even better :)
