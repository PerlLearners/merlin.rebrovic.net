To be more specific, write down everything **important**.
Early in my corporate career, I asked an experienced designer
what had helped him make the transition from a small agency to
a big company. He suggested that I should keep a permanent
track of what's happening for myself. Projects change and
people come and go so it's hard to keep everything in memory.
{% endmark %}

I took his advice to heart. I've started a journal for each
project I've worked on and have been doing it since. Even
though there is a small overhead to writing them, there are
two huge benefits:

1. No ambiguity
---------------

"I'm really happy that we're doing A."  
"Ermm â€¦ I thought we're doing B. Isn't that what we decided at the beginning of the year?"  
"I'm pretty sure it was A. I've talked with Claire and Lucas about it."  
"But A is completely at odds with our goal. Are you sure it's not B? Claire left the company in the meantime and Lucas is on a parental leave, so it's going to be hard to check what you had discussed."

This will happen. However, I want it to happen once a year,
not every week. Recording decisions, reasons, and thoughts
makes it easy to recall them later. To save time, I often copy
email snippets or meeting notes. In the spirit of open
collaboration, all my project journals are open to everyone. I
can point people to specific sections, and they can review and
comment.

2. Clear thoughts
-----------------

When I can't copy summaries, I have to write them myself. The
act of writing forces me to think through the decision or
activity once again, and it serves as an additional check.

What about project management tools?
------------------------------------

I've seen project management tools work well in smaller
companies. However, as the number of teams and diverse
projects increases, the lowest common denominator for
cross-team communication quickly becomes the holy trinity:
emails, issue trackers, and documents. Additional hurdles to
finding a common tool everyone uses are "not invented here
syndrome" and security concerns.

If everyone in your team and all your collaborators use one
tool to track progress and communicate, you're in a good
place. If not, make your own notes. You'll thank yourself
later.
