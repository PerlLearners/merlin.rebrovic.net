    The authors of 'Design for real life' use a slightly
    different language to describe edge cases, and that makes
    all the difference in how we perceive their importance.

I'm reading [Design for real life][1] by Eric Meyer & Sara
Wachter-Boettcher, and I'm enjoying one small word twist.
Instead of saying _edge cases_, they call them _stress cases_.
That change makes all the difference in how we perceive the
importance of situations that don't occur as often.

The example the authors use in the book is:

> Someone trying to shut down their account in a hurry is an
> edge case.
>
> Someone trying to shut down their account in a hurry is a
> stress case.

The first sounds dismissable. The second sounds inevitable.
