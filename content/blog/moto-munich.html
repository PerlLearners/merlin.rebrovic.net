Since I'm not a beer drinker and it's the wrong time of the
year for Oktoberfest anyway, I had to find something else to
explore on this visit. BMW, headquartered in Munich, is
preparing itself for the 100th birthday next year, so it
seemed like a good opportunity to spend one morning exploring
its history and engineering accomplishments.
