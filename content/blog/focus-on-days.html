    A short excerpt from Austin Kleon's book Share Your Work.
---

Writer and artist Austin Kleon describes how he tackles work
in [his book Share Your Work][1]:

> Building a substantial body of work takes a long
> time--lifetime, really--but thankfully, you don't need that
> time all in one big chunk. So forget about decades, forget
> about years, and forget about months. Focus on days.
>
> The day is the only unit of time that I can really get my
> head around. Seasons change, weeks are completely human
> made, but the day has a rhythm. The sun goes up; the sun
> goes down. I can handle that.

This is an excellent advice on how to approach tasks that
seem overwhelming. Just focus on days and you'll get there.
