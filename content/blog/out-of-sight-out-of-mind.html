Last two weeks were a painful reminder I'm not doing my job
properly as a designer. Oh, I solve problems and build
aesthetically pleasing interfaces, but I often forget to take
into account that some people need a bit more than that.
{% endmark %}

* I've sat next to a person on a plane who had considerable
  tremors (like in a Parkinson's disease); working on a laptop
  was a challenge.
* One person contacted me saying he has trouble discerning
  particular colors on a screen due to his particular type of
  color blindness and an ill choice of colors conveying
  information.
* I heard another story about people with different kinds of
  visual impairment.
* I was in an audience with on-site sign interpreters and live
  captions for viewers with hearing problems.

Since I don't know many people who have some kind of
impairment and I'm not in daily contact with them, they easily
slip out of my mind when building something. Writing this down
will serve as a reminder. Blaming deadlines and too many
simultaneous projects is not an excuse. This is my way of
saying "sorry" for the slip and I'll do a better job in the
future.
