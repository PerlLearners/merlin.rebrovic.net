A wide screen gives a lot of space in Vim, but what's the
point if all content is on the far left side instead in the
center? And if you have multiple windows opened, wouldn't it
be nice if you could quickly clear everything out and focus
only on one window in full screen, work for a bit and then
easily go back with all other windows restored? Focus.vim does
exactly that.

Get the plugin from [GitHub][1] and give it a try.
