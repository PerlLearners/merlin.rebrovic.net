In a few short years Git became one of the most popular source
control management system, especially for newly started and
open source projects. If you're a developer, you'll eventually
cross paths with it. I've written a post on Git tips and
tricks on Five Minutes' blog, starting from beginner and
progressing to more advanced levels. You can find it on the
link below.

There are six tips there and I'm providing number seven here
as a bonus.

## Release notes from commit messages

If you're using a [well formated commit message][format] (one
short summary line, one empty and then a longer description),
it's very easy to create simple, but effective release notes.
For example, if you released the v1.3 of your product, the
command

<code>
git log --pretty=format:"%s" --no-merges v1.2..v1.3
</code>

will print out summary lines from v1.2 (excluding) to v1.3 and
leave out merge commits. Perfect for saving to a wiki, sending
to a <abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr> team or a client
for a review.

## Other Git resources

There are two more posts I wrote about Git two years ago. If
you managed to get to here, you may also find them helpful.
