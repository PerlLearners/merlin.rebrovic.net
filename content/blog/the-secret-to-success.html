Q: Tell me the secret to success.  
A: Work hard every day.  
Q: No, really. Tell me the secret.  
A: ...

I understand the desire to find a shortcut. Hard work is,
well, hard, and we would like to avoid it if possible.
Nevertheless, I'm fascinated by this unquenchable desire even
though the answer is in plain sight. The dialog from the top
is the summary of all Q&A sessions, interviews, and self-help
books I've heard or read over the years. Hard work is often
not sufficient for success, but is a necessary component.
