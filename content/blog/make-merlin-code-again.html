Things escalated quickly :)

My interest in Google's technical infrastructure has grown
over the years. The itch to look under the hood and play with
code is always there, mostly due to my background in computer
science before [switching][1] to design.

Casual conversations with one software engineer have led me to
set up a development environment. He started to introduce me
internal tools and processes. We've been cracking jokes during
that time about how he's going to convert me to a programmer
again, and at some point someone said: "Make Merlin code
again." It stuck. I wanted to make it visible to serve as a
reminder. Instead of just printing it out and putting it over
my desk, [Olga][2] jumped in and stitched the slogan masterfully.

And don't worry, I won't crash any Google products; they won't
let me :)
