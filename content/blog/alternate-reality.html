_Note: I'm not implying any conspiracy theories or ill-doing
here. I was just intrigued by the parallels between recent
events in the real world and a fictional plot. Many big tech
companies and startups work in VR today. Consider this a fun
musing :)_

I started to read [Ready Player One][1], a science fiction and
dystopian novel by Ernest Cline. It's about a teenager being
pulled into an adventure in a digital world accessed through
VR goggles and haptic feedback gloves.

<blockquote>
<p>I'd heard of Halliday, of course. Everyone had. He was the
videogame designer responsible for creating the OASIS, a
massively multiplayer online game that had gradually evolved
into the globally networked virtual reality most of humanity
now used on a daily basis.</p>

<p>The OASIS would ultimately change the way people around the
world lived, worked, and communicated. It would transform
entertainment, social networking, and even global politics.
Even though it was initially marketed as a new kind of
massively multiplayer online game, the OASIS quickly evolved
into a new way of life.</p>

But the most interesting thing happens outside of the book, in
our own real world.

The book was published in 2011. Then, in 2012, [Oculus][2]
launches a [successful Kickstarter campaign][3] for their
virtual reality goggles Oculus Rift. They were the first one
to tackle VR by far, but they made a splash and popularized
the field once again. Their mission is to _"make it possible
to experience anything, anywhere, through the power of virtual
reality."_

In 2014, [Facebook announced][4] that they acquired Oculus
Rift for $2B. At F8 this year, [Facebook also stated their
mission][5]: _"Give everyone the power to share anything with
anyone."_

Here are further descriptions of the virtual world from the
book:

<blockquote>
<p>The OASIS quickly became the single most popular use for
the Internet, so much so that the terms "OASIS" and "Internet"
gradually became synonymous. And the incredibly easy-to-use
three-dimensional OASIS OS, which GSS gave away for free,
became the single most popular computer operating system in
the world.</p>

<p>Before long, billions of people around the world were
working and playing in the OASIS every day. Some of them met,
fell in love, and got married without ever setting foot on the
same continent. The lines of distinction between a person's
real identity and that of their avatar began to blur.</p>

<p>It was the dawn of new era, one where most of the human race
now spent all of their free time inside a videogame.</p>
