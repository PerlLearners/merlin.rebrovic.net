[Susan Farrell and Jakob Nielsen][nngroup] have made a survey
of UX professionals' careers followed by the analysis --
["User Experience Career Advice"][analysis]. I've quoted a few
snippets I found surprising or very interesting.

<blockquote>
The strongest finding from this research is that there is no
single defining characteristic of user experience careers. For
each of the main points we considered, our respondents
provided an immense diversity of answers.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
On a more detailed level, when we asked about specific
activities such as making wireframes, gathering requirements,
or running usability studies, it was also striking how diverse
UX professionals' jobs are. Fully 75% of respondents said that
they perform at least 16 different UX activities.
</blockquote>

This makes sense, especially in small teams where one person
has to cover a lot of ground. A need for a lot of knowledge
and experience is making it challenging, especially because
there are not a lot of dedicated educational institutions that
can help at the moment. That's why people are entering user
experience field from diverse areas.

<blockquote>
There's no single degree to define the field: design,
psychology, and communication were the most common major
areas, sharply pursued by English and computer science. All of
these fields make some sense as a partial educational
background for UX professionals, but together those five
disciplines accounted for only 45% of bachelor's degrees.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Digging deeper than the title on the diploma, we asked people
which of the subjects that they studied had actually turned
out to be useful. Continuing the diversity theme, there were
lots of different things that UX pros claim to find useful.
The top scores in order of usefulness were web design,
writing, programming, psychology, design, and research
methods. Any list where programming and psychology are next to
each other is clearly indicative of an interdisciplinary
field.

If you're interested in starting or transfering to a UX
career, be sure to read the [analysis] or even the the whole
[report] if you like details and helpful hints.
