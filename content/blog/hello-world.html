The initial version of my new site is finally up. It took me
almost two years to finally get started. You know how it goes,
there's always some more pressing thing to do. I found myself
with two free weekends, so I decided there would be no more
excuses.

Why build this site? The question cropped up when I was
talking to some people about the idea and I often asked it
myself when I was searching for reasons to invest some time
into it.

1. I'm a supporter of owning your own data. I have content
   elsewhere and it's great for sharing and reach, but I
   always loved the idea of having a centralized place - a
   reference if you will. I'm planning to put my thoughts and
   projects here with links to external resources if more
   appropriate. We'll see what happens after that.
2. I needed a playground. The web is evolving super fast and
   there are so many things to learn and try out. Projects I'm
   working on often have strict deadlines and requirements, so
   compromises have to be made. With this I'm completely free
   to do whatever I want. For example, I don't plan to support
   anything lower than Internet Explorer 9. The pain's just
   not worth it for this kind of site.  The fact this is a
   public playground gives me an extra insight in how things
   work.

That being said, I wanted to try out a few things here: it had
to be a clean black site, I wanted to play with typography and
build the whole site using ems and also try to build
mobile/content first responsive website. For now only I can
say it's hard. I knew that before, but I just want to repeat
it for the record. From the technical side it had to be static
pages only (no server site logic) so I'm using Hyde generator
to build it. I'll add JavaScript for dynamic stuff if need
arises.

After two weekends I'm about 20% finished. There are a lot of
things that have to be automated and refactored under the
hood. And a lot more content written. But, everything in due
time :) This website is open-sourced so you can look around if
you're interested.
