An observation from grading an art pottery class on basis of
quality and quantity.

<blockquote>
The works of highest quality were all produced by the group
being graded for quantity. While the quantity group was busily
churning out piles of work&mdash;and learning from their
mistakes&mdash;the quality group had sat theorizing about
perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their
efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.
</blockquote>
