I had a privilege to speak at [WebCamp Zagreb][wc] conference
at the end of November. It was one of the biggest (if not the
biggest) gathering of that kind in Croatia. It was development
orientated with almost 250 people coming from the whole
region. More than 60 presentations were nominated from a much
bigger pool and then the final 24 selected.

My presentation was about communication and building
interfaces. It was very well received and I'm very satisfied
with it. Here are the video and the slides in Croatian if you
want to see them.
