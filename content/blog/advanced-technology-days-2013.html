The first day of Microsoft's Advanced Technology Days is over.
I gave a presentation about the design and development process
of BliVakker mobile web shop. It was the same talk I gave on
Webcamp more than a month ago, so you can find the slides in
an [earlier post][webcamp].

Time slots were longer here so I had an opportunity to expand
more on the server-side part of the story. The back-end was
built using Microsoft's technologies by [Ignition
Development][id] from New Zealand. I briefly explained
challenges and solutions they had encountered building such a
complex web project, but I recommend you take a look at the
technical report they prepared for this occasion.
