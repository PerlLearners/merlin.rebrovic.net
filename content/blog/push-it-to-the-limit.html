I started practicing Olympic lifts recently. They are very
complex movements requiring power, perfect timing, and motor
skills. I usually start with a short warm-up, then move to the
exercise itself. I try to outdo my previous attempts, either
by increasing weight or improving technique. If I'm working on
the latter, I get tired over time and have to decrease the
weight to maintain a proper form.

My brain gets overwhelmed with new information at some point,
so it starts firing at random. I try one movement, the body
does something else; we're totally out of sync. The moment I
feel this, I stop and hit the shower. Continuing would be
non-productive and even dangerous in this case.

Learning many other things has a similar progression: start
easy, increase complexity, push your limit by a tiny bit,
rest, and then repeat. It sounds easy, but actually, it's not
easy at all. Two major mistakes happen most of the time:

1. Not reaching the limit at all. It's very easy to do that
   and I think most people fit the description. Keeping the
   task comfortable for a whole time might be productive and
   has it's uses, but it's not a way to get better.

2. Pushing it for too long. When you get to the limit,
   you should be tired (if not, you're not there yet). There
   isn't too much you can do in this state except try to focus
   and push the limit for just a tiny bit further. Trying to
   sustain that for a very long time usually results in a
   significant drop in performance, making bad decisions or
   even causing damage.

Finding that delicate balance is very hard, but not
impossible. The best way to achieve it is through deliberate
practice. Set a dedicated time to go through the whole
learning loop. Try to be conscious of your actions, feelings,
and progress, but not in a way that interrupts the flow; just
be alert enough to notice when you reach the red zone.
Then it's a perfect time to stop, rest and reflect.

The secret is in doing it again tomorrow.
