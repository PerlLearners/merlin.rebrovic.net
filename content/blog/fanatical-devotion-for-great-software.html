<blockquote cite="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">
Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to
beauty. If you look inside good software, you find that parts
no one ever supposed to see are beautiful too. When it comes
to code I behave in a way that would make me eligible for
prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way.
It drives me crazy to see code that's badly indented, or that
uses ugly variable names.

This quote from Paul Graham has been resonating with me since
I read it almost a month ago. I was going to start the
introductory paragraph with "Some programmers can recognize
themselves ..." but then I became sad. The culprit is the
word _some_.

It's bad enough many projects get ruined by the things outside
of programmers' control; it's simply tragic when they undermine
it by failing on the home turf.

I know it's wishful thinking, but sometimes I imagine how a
world would look like if everyone would give it their best. Do
_you_ give your best?
