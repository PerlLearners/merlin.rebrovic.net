[UX Munich][1] hosted some really interesting talks this year,
especially those more technical in nature. But two things
really resonated with me. The first one is from [Andy Budd][2]:

<blockquote>
Good designers want to be proved wrong, bad designers hope to
be proved right.
</blockquote>

My interpretation is that good designers and other problem
solvers use mistakes as learning opportunities, while bad ones
have fragile and defensive ego, and see compromise as a failure.

The second is from [Erik Spiekermann][3]. He was trying to
explain how he hires people and that there are more important
things than current skills.

<blockquote>
You can learn to design. You can learn to code. But you can
never unlearn to be an arsehole.
</blockquote>

"And don't work with arseholes", he said at the end. So there
you have it, no more excuses.
