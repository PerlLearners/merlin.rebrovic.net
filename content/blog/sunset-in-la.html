{% mark excerpt %}
Los Angeles and Hollywood are centers of movie studios,
upcoming celebrities, and American car culture. However, if
you drive west, you will end up in Santa Monica and Venice
where a different lifestyle takes place: surfing, outdoor
gyms, acrobatics, lifeguards, walks along the beach. And of
course, incredible sunsets.
