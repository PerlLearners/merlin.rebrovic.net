    It seems I learned how to draw in school. Boring lectures

Yesterday [I tweeted that I doodled something after a long
time][1]. It struck me this morning that I became proficient
in drawing while I was in school. There weren't any drawing
classes there, but the sheer amount of boring lectures was too
much for a curious mind. My escape from that torture was
filling any white space with doodles, comics, and sometimes,
full page drawings.
