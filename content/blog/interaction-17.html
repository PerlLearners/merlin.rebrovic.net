I have been planning to attend the Interaction conference for
years, but something always got in the way. This year I got
lucky and went to New York with more than a thousand other
design professionals. The summary: it was excellent. Mostly.
{% endmark %}

[The conference][1] is one of the biggest in the field and shines
the light on relevant topics and trends in the industry. It's
a great place for designers and researchers to get a broad
overview of what's happening. As to any human endeavor, there
were good and bad sides to it.

The good
--------

Parallel tracks during three days covered:

* Virtual reality
* Machine learning and artificial intelligence
* Conversational interfaces and chatbots
* How technology impacts our emotions and psychology
* Creating and managing design organizations
* Ethics, responsibility, and trust
* Smart environments, designing off-screen, and new
  interaction paradigms
* Design thinking and process

I'll try to summarize some of the topics from the conference.
Occasionally I'll add my thoughts about the industry in
general.

Virtual reality got the first half of the first day. I would
be surprised by this if [I didn't try it recently][2]. The
technology is transformative. Although virtual reality is not
new, it became more accessible in the last couple of years.
The most pressing questions designers have are about the
design process: how do we prototype, how do we test, and what
are the best practices? We're still in the exploration phase.

One speaker pointed out the excessive application of the "VR"
label to everything imaginable. According to her, virtual
reality is an environment where a person has agency, where a
person can interact with that environment in a meaningful way.
Everything else is an improved version of 3D goggles. I was
thinking about this a lot, and the distinction makes sense. If
you're watching a 360° live feed of a concert or enjoying a
360° computer simulation of a rollercoaster ride, it's no
different from enjoying a movie. You're just consuming media
with the ability to turn your head. You can't interact with it
in any way.

{{ macros.external_figure("2017-02-17_vr_prototype_camera.jpg",
"The IBM design team showed a nifty setup where they prepare a
paper prototype, put it in a cylinder, and take a photo with
a 360° camera.") }}

{{ macros.external_figure("2017-02-17_vr_prototype_screen.jpg",
"The photo is then opened on a phone and put in a
Google Cardboard VR headset. A monitor mirrors the headset so
other team members can see what is happening.") }}

Machine learning is another technology that has been around
for decades but had its second renaissance period in the last
few years. The reasons are improvements in computing power and
access to more data. You need a lot of data for machine
learning.

A couple of excellent presentations explained what machine
learning can accomplish, where should it be used, and where it
should be avoided. They also mentioned a big caveat: the
quality of machine learning outputs is going to be only as
good as the quality of data that feeds into algorithms. An
additional problem is unintentional bias that can negatively
affect human lives. For example, the [algorithm in the
criminal justice system used to assess the risk of
re-offending is biased against blacks][3]. I'm afraid many
people and companies today jump on the machine learning trend
thinking about technology, but not about its consequences.
Machine learning is a wonderful technology, and we'll see it
misused due to ignorance.

I couldn't attend most of the talks about conversational
interfaces and chatbots, but I heard from others they were
good. People at the conference mentioned challenges of
remembering what to say to Amazon's Echo. It was [in the press
too][4]. Other products of the same type have the same
problems.

I have reservations about the state of the voice or
conversational technology today, even though [I'm optimistic
for the future][5]. If you say anything to another person,
that person will understand you. He or she might not respond
or comply, but will understand. The machine will hear you but
understand only a tiny fraction. Until it can understand
(almost) everything, it's not as useful. It's just too hard to
remember all supported voice commands without any help. In
other words, it's not a good conversation partner. Yet.

{{ macros.external_figure("2017-02-17_echo_dos.jpg",
"Voice and command-line interfaces look very different on the
surface, but they suffer from the same problem:
discoverability of a limited set of commands. What to type in
the terminal? What to say to Alexa?") }}

Many people use WeChat as an example of a successful
conversational UI. Norman Nielsen Group conducted [research
about WeChat][6] last year:

> However, the key UX advantage of WeChat is not that it grew
> out of a chat service; it's the integrated user experience.
> Each individual service is fine, but not necessarily better
> than those offered by other companies. In fact, our user
> testing of WeChat revealed many usability problems in
> various areas. What's superior is how these services play
> together and reinforce each other. Most importantly, these
> benefits are not the result of a superior, simple
> conversational UI; **instead, they are often provided through
> a simplified graphical user interface (GUI).**

Design organizations are a hot topic for a couple of years now
([MX 15 was almost all about that][7]). It signifies a shift
in the industry--big companies are acquiring small studios or
building in-house design teams. Designers join huge and
complex organizations where they often struggle with finding
their place. How do you collaborate with dozens of other
researchers and designers, how do you work with other roles
across teams, how do you demonstrate your value to the
organization, what process to use, who is responsible for
what?

Ethics, trust, and how technology impacts humans is something
we should always have on top of our minds. There were a lot of
diverse talks on this topic, and I liked all of them. Some
common themes were:

* We build apps optimized for engagement, not for meaningful
  interactions
* People hand over too much information and control to
  technology, but they don't understand the consequences
* We often treat end-users as objects, not as living humans
  that have needs and emotions
* We build complex systems and rush to launch them without
  proper testing (I already mentioned machine learning and
  bias)

One speaker said something that made me think: _"Technology is
not neutral. Guns don't kill people, but they make it easy for
people to kill people."_ I was always in the "tech is neutral"
camp, but I have started to doubt that recently. People
respond to incentives. Every technology, whether I like it or
not, sets some incentives.

The bad
-------

I would be ecstatic about the conference if two things didn't
happen.

A significant number of speakers did a terrible job, from
keynotes to short presentations. High expectations amplified
my perception of their performance. The conference is, after
all, the best known in the industry, not a local meetup where
a person might try speaking for the first time and not perform
well. Some speakers were reading from their slides, or even
worse, asked the audience to read from them. Some were
rambling for an hour, and the only thing I remember is the
primary color of their slides. A couple of times I completely
disengaged, and once I actually left the room.

{{ macros.external_figure("2017-02-17_looking_at_phones.jpg",
"It's too easy to disengage if a talk is not interesting.") }}

The other thing was constant jabbing at the US politics and
the dissatisfaction with the current president of the US. Sly
remarks and jokes found their place in many talks. I
understand people are shocked and angered by recent events (me
included), but I don't think this kind of conference should be
a place where they vent. Rage all you want on the street, in
front of a political office, or on a social network. However,
the international part of the audience and locals with
different political beliefs might not find it amusing.

{{ macros.external_figure("2017-02-17_deport_trump.jpg",
"A detail from a street in New York.") }}

At the same time, I have to admit some speakers handled this
spectacularly. They described the current situation as
"challenging times," and were able to provide context for
their talk without pushing their agenda or political beliefs.
Kudos.

The ugly
--------

Brace yourself, a rant is approaching at supersonic speeds.
There is one thing that fills me with frustration every time I
hear it. There were traces of it at the conference, but it's a
problem of the whole industry, and that's how I want to
address it. It's four simple words.

_"We, designers, are special."_

It comes in different forms: _"We think differently. We're the
only ones who care about people. It's up to us to fix
everything. Only we can save the world. We are special
snowflakes."_ One speaker literally compared designers with
another occupation and said that designers think more
critically of themselves and their work. What the actual fuck?

Who are designers? A different species from homo sapiens?
Genetically engineered superhumans who were trained from birth
to fight bad usability and address all user needs? It seems
some designers skipped their Empathy 101 lessons.

No, designers are regular people who learned particular skills
over the years. Let me repeat the critical part: regular
people who learned some skills. Nothing more, nothing less. If
you're a designer now, nothing is stopping you from going to
law school and becoming a lawyer. Would you suddenly stop
caring about your work? I don't think so.

You can measure your design skills along multiple dimensions.
None of these should be labeled "better than other humans."
Show some humility, guys and gals.

Interaction 18
--------------

In the end, the [next year's conference][8] was announced.
Interaction 18 will take place in Lyon. That might be fun :)
