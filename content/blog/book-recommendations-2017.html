Even though I've listed only a few books on the topic, last
year I read a lot about current technology and how it may
affect our society in the future. Ethics, machines that
"think," and our inability to comprehend complexity around us
were the themes of the year, prompted by my [short post about
fairness]([[blog/what-is-fair-what-is-right.html]]) in late 2016.
Here are some of the books you should consider putting on your
reading list.

Justice: What's the right thing to do?
--------------------------------------

Michael Sandel explores theories of justice and morality that
prevail today. Through case studies, thought experiments, and
writings of ancient and modern philosophers, the author shows
that the universal set of moral laws doesn't exist. The book
didn't give me the answer I wanted at first. However, it was
the book I needed to read, and it gave me tools to help think
critically about justice and why people hold different moral
beliefs.

Weapons of Math Destruction
---------------------------

Our lives are affected by computer algorithms more than we're
aware of. When algorithms work well, they make our life
easier, but when they don't, the consequences can be
destructive in a subtle way. I've been thinking and [writing
about bias in computer models]([[blog/ml-bias.html]]) we're
building. Cathy O'Neil goes a step further and describes how
algorithms are already pervasive in finance, education, and
medicine to name just a few areas.

This book published in mid-2016 was the first from this list
that mentioned that Facebook's News Feed algorithm could
decide on the US presidency.

Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow
--------------------------------------

Following his excellent book Sapiens, in which he tells the
controversial history of how humans became the rulers of the
Earth, in Homo Deus the author Yuval Noah Harari describes
technologies and challenges we face today and how they might
change humanity forever. The first half of the book is mostly
a carryover from Sapiens; that's necessary to give context but
a bit repetitive if you've just read the prequel. However, the
second half of Homo Deus will make up for it.

The book is also the second on this year's list that mentions:

> On a more sinister note, the same study implies that in the
> next US presidential elections, Facebook could know not only
> the political opinions of tens of millions of Americans, but
> also who among them are the critical swing votes, and how
> these votes might be swung.

The book was published in 2015.

Salt Sugar Fat
--------------

Michael Moss hasn't written a cookbook nor a self-help book to
change your nutrition. No, he has chronicled how food
companies have--through their own will and sometimes market
pressure--used the three magic ingredients to make processed
food more appealing and even addictive. As a consequence, our
health has suffered and profits of those companies have
soared. I appreciated the irony of food execs skipping their
own products to eat healthier food and tobacco execs stopping
smoking because their doctors recommend it due to their poor
health.

The Accidental Superpower
-------------------------

Peter Zeihan claims that geography, transportation
opportunities, and energy sources of a country are critical to
economic development and political cooperation. He goes
through history from the time of pharaohs and describes how
specific geopolitical situations have given birth to
technological developments and dominant nations of the day. At
one point, the author focuses on the US and tells how its
demographics and energy sources are uniquely positioned to
keep the US partly independent from the global energy trade
and challenges of the aging population.

The Unthinkable: Who Survives When Disaster Strikes - and Why
-------------------------------------------------------------

Humans aren't rational thinkers, and this is especially true
during floods, fires, and similar situations when people are
just trying to save their lives. Amanda Ripley analyzes stages
we go through when we find ourselves in a life or death
situation, what's the automatic response and why (hint: it's
often wrong), and what can we do maximize our chances of
getting through. The book is filled with real-life examples,
and it tells where things have gone right and where they
didn't. The good news is that we can avoid most dangers in a
disaster situation just by taking on a bit of training and by
observing the world around us.

The Undoing Project
-------------------

The groundbreaking research in the 70s and 80s of two Israeli
psychologists, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, has
transformed psychology and earned a Nobel prize in economics.
Michael Lewis chronicles how these two very different man have
formed an unlikely partnership. The author goes deep and tells
a story of two brilliant, but still emotional humans, of
challenges they've faced with others and among themselves,
what has brought them together, and what forces have broken
them apart.

Radical candor
--------------

Kim Scott makes a case for radical candor as the right
communication style if you want to be a great boss. She says
all other approaches have some negative consequences,
including not saying anything when something should be said. I
would recommend this book to everyone, but especially to
leaders and managers.

Maus
----

Maus is a Pulitzer-awarded graphic novel by Art Spiegelman. He
tells a horrific story of how his family of Polish Jews
survived through World War II. All Jews are illustrated as
mice and all Germans as cats. The topic makes the book harder
to read, but the visual format gives it a new perspective
worth experiencing.
